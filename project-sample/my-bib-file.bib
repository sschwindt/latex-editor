Next, we consider weighted kappa to incorporate a notion of distance between rating categories, followed by the case of multiple ratings per subject with different sets of raters. We discuss applications to other problems and then relate the results of the preceding sections to the theory presented in an earlier chapter on correlated binary variables. A problem solving section appears at the end of the chapter.},

Turbidity is caused by the presence of suspended and dissolved matter, such as clay, silt, finely divided organic matter, plankton and other microscopic organisms, organic acids, and dyes. This section of the National Field Manual (NFM) describes the USGS protocols for determining turbidity in surface and ground waters, including extensive guidance for equipment selection and data reporting. It includes the revised approach to turbidity measurement and reporting that was implemented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in October 2004 to account for technological advances and consequent measurement complexities. Each chapter of the National Field Manual is published separately and revised periodically. Newly published and revised chapters will be announced on the USGS Home Page on the World Wide Web under 'New Publications of the U.S. Geological Survey.'}

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical approach to the problem of designing the opening in a slit-check dam. The approach is based on the conservation of the mass of water and sediments and on the energy balance under steady conditions. It leads to a relationship among opening width, sediment characteristics, mountain river geometry, and water and sediment discharge. The final relationship can be simplified to make it suitable for practical applications. Also, the problem of unsteadiness of both water and sediment is considered, as well as the possibility of treating the unsteady flow as a sequence of steady states. The results of the theory were checked in a laboratory investigation using a scale model. Different opening widths were tested under conditions of steady and unsteady supplies of water and sediment. The mean grain size of the sediment, as well as the rates of sediment and water discharge, were changed in the experiments. The results of the experiments confirm the theory quite well.},

  abstract = {The reconstruction of long-term ({$>$}100\,yr) channel changes is critical to understanding how natural and anthropogenic factors impact the evolution of river systems. It provides information on channel sensitivity and the limitations for channel repair in a functional river restoration context. This study presents a two-century analysis of the evolution of a large braided and anabranching river, the Upper Rhine downstream of Basel, which has experienced three phases of engineering works (nineteenth century channelization, 1930s groyne construction, and 1950s damming and by-passing). We studied historical maps, longitudinal profiles, and cross sections to investigate changes in the areas and geometries of fluvial features from 1828 to 2009. The results showed a drastic floodplain drying out following nineteenth century channelization (93\% reduction of fully connected channels, 48\% augmentation of partially connected channels, augmentation of disconnected water bodies by more than five times, and augmentation of terrestrialized channels of more than two times; 1828\textendash 1925). Changes propagated downstream at 280\,m\,yr-1 on the 50-km long river continuum. The channel exhibited bed topography of large forms in 1880, with a median pool-riffle amplitude of 4.0\,m, locally reaching 6.6\,m. Among the three phases of engineering works on the Upper Rhine, channelization had the most impact on planform (floodplain terrestrialization) and vertical (7\,cm\,yr-1 bed degradation) adjustments, with short reaction times and effects lasting several decades. Damming had the greatest impact on peak flows, and can explain the lower magnitude of the channel changes in the contemporary period. We synthetized the complex cause-effect relationships between natural/anthropogenic controlling factors and hydromorphological processes over the past 200\,yr, and outlined the evolutionary trend of the main geomorphic variables, which can be used as a knowledge framework to evaluate future morphodynamic restoration schemes.},

  abstract = {Seasonal forecasting systems, and related systems for decadal prediction, are crucial in the development of adaptation strategies to climate change. However, despite important achievements in this area in the last 10 years, significant levels of skill are only generally found over regions strongly connected with the El Nin\texttildelow{} o\textendash Southern Oscillation. With the aim of improving the skill of regional climate predictions in tropical and extratropical regions from intraseasonal to interannual time scales, a new Met Office global seasonal forecasting system (GloSea4) has been developed. This new system has been designed to be flexible and easy to upgrade so it can be fully integrated within the Met Office model development infrastructure. Overall, the analysis here shows an improvement of GloSea4 when compared to its predecessor. However, there are exceptions, such as the increased model biases that contribute to degrade the skill of Nin\texttildelow{} o-3.4 SST forecasts starting in November. Global ENSO teleconnections and Madden\textendash Julian oscillation anomalies are well represented in GloSea4. Remote forcings of the North Atlantic Oscillation by ENSO and the quasi-biennial oscillation are captured albeit the anomalies are weaker than those found in observations. Hindcast length issues and their implications for seasonal forecasting are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Water resources development and management is imperative for sustainable agriculture in water scarce areas. In Pakistan, the state of Punjab has constructed 32 small dams, in the Pothwar region, to store and conserve water for agricultural production. However, little information is available on the impact of these small dams on agriculture and socio-economic conditions of the area. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of three small dams, Jawa, Kasala and Dhok Sanday Mar, on agriculture and groundwater development in the area and to provide guidelines for the effective utilization and sustainable management of small dams in Pakistan. Data related to on-farm practices were collected during personal interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire. Water-table depth was measured from the open wells in the area with a water-table recorder. Secondary data such as inflow, outflow, rainfall, water charges and land use were collected from small dams organization. After the construction of these dams and irrigation canals, cropping intensity and crop yield have increased. Due to availability of irrigation water there has been a shift of cropping pattern from wheat and forage crops to vegetable crops. Farmers are earning up to \$2433 per ha per year. An analysis of inflow\textendash outflow of the dams shows that, if properly managed, the storage is sufficient to irrigate all the crop lands within the command area. The depth to the water table has also decreased since the dams were constructed. The water table varies from 6 to 15m in the irrigated areas served by the Khasala dam as compared to 7\textendash 39m before the dam was constructed. The water table depths for the areas served by the Jawa dam ranged from 7 to 39m before the dam was constructed to 9\textendash 25m after construction. The shallower water table has made the groundwater accessible and as a result the number of wells has increased. This has reduced drudgery on the local inhabitants particularly for women who had to fetch water from far away for their domestic uses. The area has potential for expanding both land use and cropping intensities, if innovative irrigation and agronomic practices are adopted. Moreover, mobilizing local water user associations, proper maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and technical support of the agricultural and extension services can enhance the productivity in the area.},

This hyperbolic system of conservation laws is solved on unstructured meshes by a kinetic scheme based on a finite volume approach. An important property of this scheme is the preservation of the water height positivity when applications with dry areas are considered. Following some hypothesis an entropy inequality is proved. The standard kinetic scheme is modified to deal with varying bed slope and particularly to preserve equilibrium states such as still water. Moreover the source terms due to the arbitrary bottom topography have to be discretized in such a way to balance the flux gradients for these equilibriums. We illustrate the properties of the scheme on different test cases for which exact solutions are available and on more realistic applications.},

The moored observations show that instability builds at the surface on scales of hours, water near the bottom of the lake begins warming roughly 6 h after sunup, and the water column homogenizes a few hours after sundown. Glider observations suggest the existence of distinct convective chimneys, which carry warmed water to depth with horizontal scales on the order of tens of meters. Patches of photoquenched phytoplankton coincide with patches of anomalously warm water, providing a secondary tracer of water recently in the euphotic zone, and provide insight into the vertical development of convective chimneys. An analysis of the abundance of convective chimneys is used to estimate the lateral scale of convective cells, which appears to be on the order of 50 m.},

  abstract = {Several mathematical models for analyzing reservoir temperature stratification have recently been developed. In general, these involve examination of hourly temperature changes. Their use in practical applications is limited because of the large amounts of observational data required. There is an increasing use of reservoir storage for bridging drought periods of several years which requires examination of many combinations of reservoir storage levels and seasonal inflow patterns. Consequently, it is not possible to select a few representative years for analysis, and ordinarily 30 or more years of data are required. It is practical to do this only if a long computation interval, such as one month, can be used. Much of the observational data needed in existing models is ordinarily not available. A practical model must use generalized data such as average air temperature and average radiation. A generalized model must be capable of making releases through specific outlets or automatically selecting the outlets that will maintain outflow temperatures within a desired range as long as possible and leave the temperature of the remaining stored water at an optimum value. A computer program has been developed that conforms to the above requirements and automatically calibrates the model.},

The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients. We anticipate the new maps will be useful for numerous applications, including species and vegetation distribution modeling.

  abstract = {The Zambezi Delta is vital to Mozambique's national economy and is a Wetland of International Importance. Large dams in the Zambezi catchment have substantially altered the magnitude, timing, duration, and frequency of flooding events in the delta, resulting in adverse ecological and socio-economic changes. We evaluated conflicts/trade-offs among various water uses and the potential for improving delta conditions through environmental flow releases from Cahora Bassa Dam, using the downstream response to imposed flow transformations (Brown, C.A. and Joubert, A., 2003. Using multicriteria analysis to develop environmental flow scenarios for rivers targeted for water resource development. Water SA, 29 (4), 365\textendash 374; King, J.M., Brown, C.A., and Sabet, H., 2003. A scenario-based holistic approach to environmental flow assessments for regulated rivers. Rivers Research and Applications, 19 (5\textendash 6), 619\textendash 640) model. Five variations in low flows, 18 alternatives for annual floods, and one extreme (1:5 year) flood were considered for a range of uses/concerns, including commercial and small-scale agriculture, estuarine ecology, coastal and freshwater fisheries, livestock, large mammals, waterbirds, vegetation, invasive species, natural resources, water quality, navigation, and groundwater recharge. The study revealed minimal trade-offs among different uses with regard to reinstating environmental flows. The majority of user-representatives perceive reinstatement of the annual flood to be beneficial and the perceived benefits increase with increased magnitude and prolonged duration, provided the timing of the annual flood occurs during the normal wet season. Simulation modelling of the Zambezi system dam operation indicates that these environmental flow releases can be realized within the constraints of firm power commitments and total energy demand. Of the 18 annual flood change levels considered, 7 can be generated with a firm power reliability {$>$}95\% and hydropower reductions of {$<$}2.3\%, and 16 require {$<$}10\% reduction in annual energy production. This work illustrates the potential for environmental flows to overcome conflict in shared water resources and create opportunities for cooperation.},

  abstract = {Pumped-storage hydroelectric power plants are generally perceived as an environmentally respectful technology. Nevertheless, the pumping of water from a lower reservoir to an upper impoundment, and the return of that water during power generation, can strongly affect the water quality of the reservoirs. In particular, plant operation can alter their thermal structure, deep water mixing, and water circulation characteristics. The objective of this study is to quantify, through the use of 3D hydrodynamic modeling, the potential impacts of a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant on the thermal stability and mixing of two reservoirs in Galicia, northwest of Spain. To this end, three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were conducted using the model Delft3D. Two different coupled models, one for each reservoir, were constructed and subsequently tested for several stratification scenarios, according to measured temperature profiles during the spring and summer season. Several reservoir minimum and maximum operation water levels were also considered. Model simulations demonstrated a high level of mixing in the vicinity of the intake-outlet structures, in particular during startup of the power plant, regardless of the water level in the reservoir. Beyond this area, the results showed a limited overall effect on stratification and mixing in the upper reservoir, owing to the relation between the inflow temperatures and the initial temperature profile of this reservoir. A more significant alteration of the thermal structure is expected in the lower reservoir due to its narrow shape and shallow depth at the structure location, as well as the temperature differences between receiving waters and inflow.},

  abstract = {Microbial biofilms assemble from cells that attach to a surface, where they develop into matrix-enclosed communities. Mechanistic insights into community assembly are crucial to better understand the functioning of natural biofilms, which drive key ecosystem processes in numerous aquatic habitats. We studied the role of the suspended microbial community as the source of the biofilm community in three streams using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the 16S rRNA gene (as a measure for the active and the bulk community, respectively). Diversity was consistently lower in the biofilm communities than in the suspended stream water communities. We propose that the higher diversity in the suspended communities is supported by continuous inflow from various sources within the catchment. Community composition clearly differed between biofilms and suspended communities, whereas biofilm communities were similar in all three streams. This suggests that biofilm assembly did not simply reflect differences in the source communities, but that certain microbial groups from the source community proliferate in the biofilm. We compared the biofilm communities with random samples of the respective community suspended in the stream water. This analysis confirmed that stochastic dispersal from the source community was unlikely to shape the observed community composition of the biofilms, in support of species sorting as a major biofilm assembly mechanism. Bulk and active populations generated comparable patterns of community composition in the biofilms and the suspended communities, which suggests similar assembly controls on these populations.},

The author makes simulations of the flume experiment using four numerical morphodynamic model systems to which the following sediment continuity models are applied: the commonly applied active layer model (A), a two-layer model (B), a sorting evolution model while assuming bed form size to be regular (C1), and a sorting evolution model while taking into account the variability in bed form geometry (C2). The model systems that incorporate the variability of bed form geometry, i.e., the two-layer model and the sorting evolution model with irregular dunes, show an improved prediction of the adaptation timescale of the composition of both the bed surface and the transported sediment, as well as the vertical sorting profile. This is because including the variability of bed form geometry enables the model system to account for sediment being stored (temporarily) at elevations that are exposed to the flow less frequently. Future application of both models to field cases is difficult, however, as the two-layer model is not sufficiently generic and may lead to ellipticity of its set of equations, whereas the sorting evolution model requires a very small numerical time step.},

  abstract = {Sustainability, equitable allocation and protection of water resources must occur within the framework of integrated management and water governance, but its implementation is problematic. Ongoing global climate change, increasing population, urbanization, and aspirations for better living standards present a challenge to the planetary sustainability. While water use at global scale currently seems to be within its planetary boundary, shortages prevail in several water-scarce and overpopulated regions, and are projected to increase. Furthermore large-scale impoverishment of aquatic biodiversity, ecosystem degradation and reductions in water quality are unaddressed `side effects' in areas where water can be secured for human and economic uses. As the world prepares for Rio+20, challenges to the sustainability of global water security should be scrutinized. Of particular concern is the likelihood that the water-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets may not be achievable due to lack of funding commitments, and a failure of delivery mechanisms including water governance. Constraints on water availability and reductions in water quality jeopardize secure access to this resource for all legitimate stakeholders, including aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Water connects several socio-ecological, economic and geophysical systems at multiple scales and hence constitutes a `global water system'. This should be considered both in technical interventions and in governance frameworks. Humans have been changing the global water system in globally significant ways since the industrial revolution, yet without adequate knowledge of the system and its response to change; and without sufficient understanding of how to govern the system at local and global scales. Water security in the 21st century will require better linkage of science and policy, as well as innovative and cross-sectoral initiatives, adaptive management and polycentric governance models that involve all stakeholders. Consensus solutions will need to be achieved by evidence-based mediation, rather than following untested `panaceas', so as to ensure equitable and sustainable global water use.},

Here we present an unprecedentedly high resolution (250 \texttimes{} 250 m) global potential soil erosion model, using a combination of remote sensing, GIS modelling and census data. We challenge the previous annual soil erosion reference values as our estimate, of 35.9 Pg yr-1 of soil eroded in 2012, is at least two times lower. Moreover, we estimate the spatial and temporal effects of land use change between 2001 and 2012 and the potential offset of the global application of conservation practices. Our findings indicate a potential overall increase in global soil erosion driven by cropland expansion. The greatest increases are predicted to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. The least developed economies have been found to experience the highest estimates of soil erosion rates.},

  abstract = {1. The hyporheic zone below the channel and banks of many rivers where surface water and ground water exchanges plays a crucial functional role in the biogeochemical transformation of water, mediated by active microbial biofilms. This zone also harbours assemblages of invertebrates that graze biofilms, contribute to secondary production, and can alter the porosity of the hyporheic zone through their movement or burrowing activities. 2. Many human activities cause interstitial sedimentation or disrupt surface\textendash groundwater hydrological linkages, impacting upon ecological processes in the hyporheic zone. However, strategies for river rehabilitation seldom explicitly consider the hyporheic zone or seek to restore lost vertical linkages with groundwater. Instead, restoration goals target surface, riparian or floodplain features even though current river ecosystem theory emphasises the three dimensions of hydrological connectivity. To guide effective, holistic river restoration, scientists and managers therefore need information on the mechanisms by which energy and material are transferred in the hyporheic zone and which ecosystem services are thus provided. 3. Other gaps in our understanding of hyporheic zone rehabilitation include recruitment processes of the hyporheos and the relative importance of groups of hyporheic invertebrates in rivers differing in substratum size, disturbance frequency and groundwater linkages. Carefully designed experiments that assess responses to hyporheic rehabilitation strategies will provide valuable data at varying scales (e.g. distribution of hyporheic habitat types at the reach scale) for management as well as providing insights into the mechanisms controlling hyporheic invertebrate assemblages and ecological processes. Fully successful river rehabilitation must include restoration of vertical linkages between the river and its shallow groundwater aquifers.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {Nature-based measures (NBMs), understood here as measures such as floodplain restoration that use ecosystem processes to meet societal challenges, are increasingly advocated as promising solutions for managing flood risks. A suitable instrument to implement NBMs are flood risk management plans (FRMPs) stipulated by the EU Floods Directive. While prior research suggests several governance challenges for NBM uptake in FRMPs, little is known so far regarding the actual extent of NBM uptake and its role in decision-making of flood risk management. Germany, with a coherent water policy framework but state-specific implementation conditions, provides a suitable case study for exploring the decision-making practices that are used in the planning process for FRMPs by German federal states with different water governance characteristics. The aim of this study is to analyze the actual uptake of NBMs in German FRMPs, and to explore potential factors of the FRMP preparation and decision-making practices explaining this uptake. Our explorative research design is based on a document analysis method which assesses the contents of FRMPs of three German federal states. The results offer the first empirical evidence of the uptake of NBMs in Germany and insights into how NBMs and other measure types are chosen for FRMPs. Our findings confirm an overall low uptake of NBMs, with diverging preferences for particular NBM types between the three states. Looking across the states, the level of NBM uptake is likely to be higher if rivers with higher stream order are considered in the FRMP's spatial scope, the potential flood risk in a river basin is low, and positive flood impacts and positive cost-benefit ratios are expected. We conclude that FRMPs still hold substantial potential to enhance the NBM uptake in flood risk management planning. To make use of this potential, we suggest three key strategies to increase the change for a better NBM uptake including applying FRMPs at different spatial levels and degrees of details.},

  abstract = {Policy search methods provide a heuristic mapping between observations and decisions and have been widely used in reservoir control studies. However, recent studies have observed a tendency for policy search methods to overfit to the hydrologic data used in training, particularly the sequence of flood and drought events. This technical note develops an extension of bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and cross-validation techniques, inspired by the machine learning literature, to improve reservoir control policy performance on out-of-sample hydrological sequences. We explore these methods using a case study of Folsom Reservoir, California, using control policies structured as binary trees, and streamflow resampling based on the paleo-inflow record. Results show that calibration-validation strategies for policy selection coupled with certain ensemble aggregation methods can improve out-of-sample performance in water supply and flood risk objectives over baseline performance given fixed computational costs. Our findings highlight the potential to improve policy search methodologies by leveraging these well-established model training strategies from machine learning.},

While together these two fields have made significant scientific and social contributions to creating synthetic landscapes, it is presently infeasible to build artificial digital rivers that represent the diversity found on Earth. To understand and summarize the state of the science of rendering artificial river topography, we reviewed {$>$}225 scientific articles and produced a road map for artificial synthesis of digital river topography. We broadly classify methods of digital river synthesis by whether they are driven by expert-based decisions or are strategic in the use of rules for objective rendering, with some rules being physics-based theories of river morphogenesis. Expert approaches include map, brush, geometric and interactive design. Strategic approaches include deterministic equilibrium models, morphodynamic models, and stochastic approaches. For each approach we discuss the conceptual basis for each method and how they can be applied. Readers can then identify what methods can create different types of digital riverscapes. We close by discussing how cross pollination can serve geomorphology and computer science, the role of digital rivers in furthering geoscience progress, and future directions in digital river synthesis.},

This paper summarizes research done to support the re-operation of the Katse Dam in Lesotho, the Clanwilliam and Kogelberg Dams in South Africa, the Cahora Bassa Dam in Mozambique and the Nyumba ya Munga Dam in Tanzania in ways that would reduce their downstream impacts. For each, the original and suggested new operating rules are presented, and the reasons for the suggested changes are summarized. The negotiation and decision-making processes relevant to each dam are also discussed, and some of the challenges faced at two of the dams (Katse and Kogelberg), where revised operating rules have been implemented, are reviewed.},

  abstract = {Reach-scale morphological channel classifications are underpinned by the theory that each channel type is related to an assemblage of reach- and catchment-scale hydrologic, topographic, and sediment supply drivers. However, the relative importance of each driver on reach morphology is unclear, as is the possibility that different driver assemblages yield the same reach morphology. Reach-scale classifications have never needed to be predicated on hydrology, yet hydrology controls discharge and thus sediment transport capacity. The scientific question is: do two or more regions with quantifiable differences in hydrologic setting end up with different reach-scale channel types, or do channel types transcend hydrologic setting because hydrologic setting is not a dominant control at the reach scale? This study answered this question by isolating hydrologic metrics as potential dominant controls of channel type. Three steps were applied in a large test basin with diverse hydrologic settings (Sacramento River, California) to: (1) create a reach-scale channel classification based on local site surveys, (2) categorize sites by flood magnitude, dimensionless flood magnitude, and annual hydrologic regime type, and (3) statistically analyze two hydrogeomorphic linkages. Statistical tests assessed the spatial distribution of channel types and the dependence of channel type morphological attributes by hydrologic setting. Results yielded 10 channel types. Nearly all types existed across all hydrologic settings, which is perhaps a surprising development for hydrogeomorphology. Downstream hydraulic geometry relationships were statistically significant. In addition, cobble-dominated uniform streams showed a consistent inverse relationship between slope and dimensionless flood magnitude, an indication of dynamic equilibrium between transport capacity and sediment supply. However, most morphological attributes showed no sorting by hydrologic setting. This study suggests that median hydraulic geometry relations persist across basins and within channel types, but hydrologic influence on geomorphic variability is likely due to local influences rather than catchment-scale drivers. \textcopyright{} 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The structure and function of rivers have long been characterized either by: (1) qualitative models such as the River Continuum Concept or Serial Discontinuity Concept which paint broad descriptive portraits of how river habitats and communities vary, or (2) quantitative models, such as downstream hydraulic geometry, which rely on a limited number of measurements spread widely throughout a river basin. In contrast, authors such as Fausch et al. (2002) and Wiens (2002) proposed applying existing quantitative, spatially comprehensive ecology and landscape ecology methods to rivers. This new framework for river sciences which preserves variability and spatial relationships is called a riverine landscape or a \dbend riverscape\dbend. Application of this riverscape concept requires information on the spatial distribution of organism-scale habitats throughout entire river systems. This article examines the ways in which recent technical and methodological developments can allow us to quantitatively implement and realize the riverscape concept. Using 3-cm true color aerial photos and 5-m resolution elevation data from the River Tromie, Scotland, we apply the newly developed Fluvial Information System which integrates a suite of cutting edge, high resolution, remote sensing methods in a spatially explicit framework. This new integrated approach allows for the extraction of primary fluvial variables such as width, depth, particle size, and elevation. From these first-order variables, we derive second-order geomorphic and hydraulic variables including velocity, stream power, Froude number and shear stress. Channel slope can be approximated from available topographic data. Based on these first and second-order variables, we produce riverscape metrics that begin to explore how geomorphic structures may influence river habitats, including connectivity, patchiness of habitat, and habitat distributions. The results show a complex interplay of geomorphic variable and habitat patchiness that is not predicted by existing fluvial theory. Riverscapes, thus, challenge the existing understanding of how rivers structure themselves and will force development of new paradigms.},

These papers have proved controversial, in part because of a lack of direct evidence for a mechanism to explain the phenomenon. Now, in experiments involving manipulation of the number of algal species in model stream systems, Bradley Cardinale provides one such mechanism. Uptake of nitrogen nutrients increased linearly with species richness in response to changes in flow habitats and disturbance regimes. But when niche structure was experimentally removed, the relationship disappeared. This suggests that habitats with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment than do less-species-rich habitats, allowing the more diverse systems to capture a greater fraction of biologically active resources such as nitrogen.},

  abstract = {During the last 30 years, river restoration activities aiming to improve the functionality of degraded fluvial ecosystems increased markedly. For large rivers, it remains difficult to evaluate restoration efficiency and sustainability due to the lack of standardized monitoring metrics. From 2010 to 2016, three gravel augmentations were performed on the Old Rhine, a by-passed reach downstream from the Kembs dam (France- Germany). A geomorphic monitoring combining topo-bathymetric surveys, bedload tracking and hydraulic modelling allows to evaluate the successfulness of these actions. Results show that, to be mobilized, artificial sediment deposit should be located in concavity rather than convexity areas, due to higher shear stresses for moderate floods (Q2). Sediment starvation appeared rapidly on the restored reaches once the sediment wave moved downstream, as a consequence of limited upstream sediment supply. Bathymetric homogenization was observed along and downstream from the restored reaches without creation of new fluvial forms. This research highlights that future actions should include channel enlargement downstream of gravel augmentations, which would promote sediment deposition and habitat diversification. Sediments excavated during artificial widening could be stored and injected progressively into the upstream part of the Old Rhine to benefit the downstream sections.},

  abstract = {Quantitative models of landform development can help us to understand the evolution of mountains and regional topography, and the effects of tectonic motions and climate on landscape, including its fractal geometry. This paper presents a general and powerful three-dimensional model of fluvial erosion and deposition at hill- to mountain-range scale. The model works by accumulating the effects of randomly seeded storms or floods (precipitons) that cause diffusional smoothing then move downslope on digital topography grids, that erode portions of elevation differences, that transport a slope-limited amount of eroded material, and that deposit alluvium when their sediment-carrying capacity is exceeded. The iteration of these simple and almost linear rules produce very complicated simulated landscapes, demonstrating that complex landscapes do not require complex laws. Each process implemented in the model is affected differently by changes in horizontal scale. Erosion, a scale-free process, roughens topography at all wavelengths. This roughening is balanced by diffusive processes (scaling as 1L2) at short wavelengths and deposition (scaling (scaling as 1L2) at long wavelenghts. Such a mixture of scale-free and scale-dependent processes can produce multifractal behavior in the models. The fractal dimension of the model topography is much more sensitive to climatic variables than to tectonic uplift. Landscape evolution may be fractal, but it does not seem to be chaotic. Analysis of topography of areas in southern Arizona using variograms shows approximately fractal behavior, with mean fractal dimension around 2.2\dbend 2.3. Departures from an exact fractal relatioship imply that the topography is in detail multifractal. The fractal dimension at short wavelengths is less than that at long wavelengths. This variation could either be caused by the relative strengths of diffusive and erosional processes shaping the topography, or a result of changes in climatic or tectonic conditions still preserved in the landscape.},

  abstract = {The discovery and analysis of community structure in networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the physics community, but most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for very large networks because of their computational cost. Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(mdlogn) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m{$\sim$}n and d{$\sim$}logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2\texttimes 106 edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

  abstract = {Both the apparent bedload velocity and the backscattering strength measured by acoustic Doppler current profilers could assist bedload assessment in the field. To test this hypothesis, two ADCPs working at three frequencies (3 MHz and 1 MHz, M9; 2 MHz, StreamPro) were deployed simultaneously to measure seven different bedload transport conditions in a laboratory flume. The bedload transport was monitored by two high-speed cameras and a bedload trap. For some experiments 3 MHz and 1 MHz delivered spatially averaged apparent velocity, for others the velocity corresponded to the average velocity of particles. The 2 MHz severely underestimated the average particle velocity. The M9 backscattering strength decreased as the bedload concentration increased, independently of the size and velocity of transported particles. The 2 MHz resulted in almost constant backscattering strength. These findings demonstrate that further examination of the acoustic configurations and parameters could lead to a methodology for bedload quantification based solely on the acoustic outputs.},

  abstract = {Bars are large sediment deposits alternating with deeper areas that arise from alluvial river bed instability and forcing. The present study aimed at investigating the combined influence of flow and longitudinal width variations on the co-evolution between bar pattern and sediment sorting in a sandy-gravel river reach. To this goal, a fully non-linear 2D numerical model was developed to reproduce the morphodynamic behavior of bars in a reach of the Loire River consisting in a typical channel expansion/contraction. Numerical results showed that varying water discharge promoted a competition between low and high bar modes: i.e., from alternate to multiple bar patterns. Low bar modes were associated with coarse sediment over bar tops and fine sediment in pools, and this sorting pattern was inverted for higher bar modes. Surface sediment was coarser and the degree of sediment sorting was greater after periods of low than high flow. Due to high sediment mobility, sediment sorting did not significantly modify bar morphodynamics.},

  abstract = {Rivers typically present heterogeneous bed material, but the effects of sediment nonuniformity on river bar characteristics are still unclear. This work investigates the impact of sediment size heterogeneity on alternate bars with a morphodynamic numerical model. The model is first used to reproduce a laboratory experiment showing alternate bar formation with nonuniform bed material. Subsequently, the influence of sediment size heterogeneity on alternate bars is investigated distinguishing hybrid from free bars, definition based on the presence/absence of morphodynamic forcing, considering the results of nine scenarios. In four of them, a transverse obstacle is used to generate forcing. The computations are carried out with the Telemac-Mascaret system solving the two-dimensional shallow-water equations with a finite element approach, accounting for horizontal and vertical sediment sorting processes. The results show that sediment heterogeneity affects free migrating and hybrid bars in a different way. The difference lies in the presence/absence of a migration front, so that distinct relations between bed topography, bed shear stress, and sediment sorting are obtained. Sediment sorting and associated planform redistribution of bed roughness only slightly modify free migrating bar morphodynamics, whereas hybrid bars are greatly impacted, with decreased amplitude and increased wavelength. Increased sediment size heterogeneity increases the degree of sediment sorting, while the sorting pattern remains the same for both free and hybrid bars. Moreover, it produces averagely higher, longer, and faster free bars, while in the case of hybrid bars their wavelength is increased but no general trend can be determined for their amplitude.},

The classical means of solving such problems were primarily focused on scalarizing multiple objectives into a single objective, whereas the evolutionary means have been to solve a multi-objective optimization problem as it is. In this chapter, we discuss the fundamental principles of multi-objective optimization, the differences between multi-objective optimization and single-objective optimization, and describe a few well-known classical and evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization. Two application case studies reveal the importance of multi-objective optimization in practice. A number of research challenges are then highlighted. The chapter concludes by suggesting a few tricks of the trade and mentioning some key resources to the field of multi-objective optimization.},

  abstract = {Substrate facies monitoring is critical for the understanding of fluvial geomorphologic and ecohydraulic patterns and processes. However, direct substrate measurement is time-consuming and subjected to data sparsity because of small sample, size, and limited data collections within an area of interest, which make it difficult to capture facies patterns. Most new experimental studies focus on mapping substrate based on median grain size of a specific grain size class using automatic or semiautomatic photosieving techniques. This study aimed to develop and apply a method to accurately predict size-mixture facies patterns on exposed riverbeds with minimal ground truth plots (100) using airborne lidar and machine learning. The selected testbed river was a 37.5-km stretch of the regulated lower Yuba River in California, USA, mapped at sub-meter resolution in 2017. First, we designed a grid-by-point grain size sampling method and binned grain sizes into representative mixtures, such as fine or large gravel, to assign subaerial facies labels. Second, we classified facies based on a multivariate cluster analysis. Third, we generated 15 lidar-derived topographic and spectral predictors. Six distinct size-mixture facies were identified from field data and a seventh, pure sand facies, from UAV data. A random forest predictive model with an 84\% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy was applied to produce a facies map at the 1.54\,m pixel scale. The detrended elevation was identified as the most important variable for predicting facies spatial patterning, followed by baseflow, wetted area proximity, and green lidar intensity. We conclude that machine learning combined with intensity lidar data is highly effective for distinguishing mixed classes of substrates. Ultimately, the new substrate mixture-binning approach also provides novel insights into the arrangement of river sediment facies patterns.},

  abstract = {In this study, a hydromorphological model of the Rosenheim reservoir, one of the impoundments formed by a chain of run-of-river power plants along the Inn River (Germany), was developed by coupling TELEMAC-2D and SISYPHE. Available bathymetry surveys, conducted after the high magnitude flood events in 2005 and 2013, were used for calibration and validation respectively. The implementation of the subroutines modified by the Chair of Hydraulic and Water Resources Engineering of the Technical University of Munich together with the selection of a low angle of friction of the sediment for the secondary currents correction produced a good match between the measured and simulated cross-section profiles. The model's ability to predict the bed variation after the event was evaluated using the Brier Skill Score (BSS) and considering the initial bathymetry as the baseline prediction. Applying this technique, the three following parameters were considered: (i) phase error to assess the accuracy of the location of erosion and deposition processes, (ii) amplitude error to evaluate the bed evolution magnitude and (iii) mean map error to estimate the bias of the simulation against the measurements. The model was successfully calibrated and validated with BSS values being in the category of excellent and good together with a high number of cross-sections featuring low phase, amplitude and mean map errors. The calibrated model is presently applied to other flood events in the reservoir.},

Both models were set up using the same horizontal and vertical discretisation and forced by a horizontally resolved wind field. Model simulations were carried out during a stable stratification period in summer. Oscillations of the simulated and the measured isotherms in Lake \"Uberlingen (north basin of Upper Lake Constance) indicated the existence of a Kelvin-type wave with a period of 84 h. The major wave pattern in period and amplitude was consistent between the simulations and the measurements, whereas discrepancies appeared in the phase match. The measured and the simulated vertical velocity structure in the middle of the main basin of Upper Lake Constance showed occurrence of a Poincar\'e-type wave with a 14 h period. Major oscillations of the velocity structure were captured by both models, and the agreement between the simulations and the measurements was higher in deep layers than in near-surface layers. Model prediction of the near-surface velocities as well as the surface circulation pattern was more accurate under high current velocities during strong winds than under weak winds. This study concluded that both ELCOM and Delft3D were significantly skilled at simulating internal wave motions and surface currents, and there was no significant difference in reproducing the measured lake dynamics between ELCOM and Delft3D.},

In this study, we analysed the capability of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (EFDC) to capture water temperature and vertical diffusivity in Lake Arendsee in the Northern German plain. Of particular interest to us is to evaluate the model performance for capturing the diffusion minimum within the metalimnion and analyse the response of the metalimnetic Kz to meteorological forcing, namely changing wind speed and warming. The comparison confirmed that the calibrated model could reproduce both stratification dynamics and vertical diffusion profiles in the lake. The model was also shown to be able to capture the duration and vertical extent of the metalimnetic diffusion minimum. The scenario results illustrate that, compared to air temperature, wind velocity appeared to be the more influential meteorological variable on the vertical exchange within the metalimnion. While increasing wind velocities mostly affected the minimum values of Kz in the metalimnion and thus led to intensified vertical exchange, the reduction of wind velocity mostly affected the depth of minimal Kz, but not its absolute value.},

The design space for creating emotional virtual environments is ample, and no clear idea of how to integrate the various components exists.

  abstract = {Observed changes in precipitation patterns, rising surface temperature, increases in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, widespread melting of ice, and reduced snow cover are some of the documented hydrologic changes associated with global climate change. Climate change is therefore expected to affect the water supply-demand balance in the Northeast United States and challenge existing water management strategies. The hydrological implications of future climate will affect the design capacity and operating characteristics of dams. The vulnerability of water resources systems to floods and droughts will increase, and the trade-offs between reservoir releases to maintain flood control storage, drought resilience, ecological flow, human water demand, and energy production should be reconsidered. We used a Neural Networks based General Reservoir Operation Scheme to estimate the implications of climate change for dams on a regional scale. This dynamic daily reservoir module automatically adapts to changes in climate and re-adjusts the operation of dams based on water storage level, timing, and magnitude of incoming flows. Our findings suggest that the importance of dams in providing water security in the region will increase. We create an indicator of the Effective Degree of Regulation (EDR) by dams on water resources and show that it is expected to increase, particularly during drier months of year, simply as a consequence of projected climate change. The results also indicate that increasing the size and number of dams, in addition to modifying their operations, may become necessary to offset the vulnerabilities of water resources systems to future climate uncertainties. This is the case even without considering the likely increase in future water demand, especially in the most densely populated regions of the Northeast.},

It is concluded that the helical motion introduced by the channel curvature may be fairly well described. The results are then applied to the more complex problem of flow in a river bend with movable bed. Next, the problem of flow in a meandering channel with fixed side walls has been investigated, using a special system of curvilinear coordinates. The solution of the linearized flow equations yields a method for calculation of the distribution of the bed shear stress. In the first approximation the large-scale bottom geometry is calculated by considering the lateral sediment balance. The helical flow will move the sediment particles towards the curvature center, while the transverse slope of the bed will give a movement in the opposite direction.},

  abstract = {Crowd-based hydrological observations can supplement existing monitoring networks and allow data collection in regions where otherwise no data would be available. In the citizen science project CrowdWater, repeated water level observations using a virtual staff gauge approach result in time series of water level classes (WL-classes). To investigate the quality of these observations, we compared the WL-class data with ``real'' (i.e., measured) water levels from the same stream at a nearby gauging station. We did this for nine locations where citizen scientists reported multiple observations using a smartphone app and at 12 locations where signposts were set up to ask citizens to record observations on a paper form that could be left in a letterbox. The results indicate that the quality of the data collected with the app was better than for the forms. A possible explanation is that for each app location, a single person submitted the vast majority of the observations, whereas at the locations of the forms almost every observation was made by a different person. On average, there were more contributions between May and September than during the other months. Observations were submitted for a range of flow conditions, with a higher fraction of high flow observations for the locations were data were collected with the app. Overall, the results are encouraging for citizen science approaches in hydrology and demonstrate that the smartphone application and the virtual staff gauge are a promising approach for crowd-based water level class observations.},

  abstract = {Because eroded sediments are produced from different sources throughout a basin, it is often advantageous to model sediment delivery processes at basin scale using a spatially distributed approach. In this paper, a sediment delivery distributed (SEDD) model applicable at morphological unit scale, into which a basin is divided, is initially proposed. The model is based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), in which different expressions of the erosivity and topographic factors are considered, coupled with a relationship for evaluating the sediment delivery ratio of each morphological unit. Then the SEDD model is calibrated by sediment yield and rainfall and runoff measurements carried out, at annual and event scales, in three small Calabrian experimental basis. At event scale, the analysis showed that a good agreement between measured and calculated basin sediment yields can be obtained using the simple rainfall erosivity factor; the agreement is independent of the selected equations for estimating the topographic factors. The analysis developed at annual scale showed that the model reliability increases from the event scale to the annual scale. Finally, a Monte Carlo technique was used for evaluating the effects of the uncertainty of the model parameters on calculated sediment yield.},

Information provided by eyewitnesses via social media is a valuable information source, which should be explored in a\textasciitilde more effective way. This research proposes a methodology that leverages social media content to support rapid inundation mapping, including inundation extent and water depth in the case of floods. The novelty of this approach is the utilization of quantitative data that are derived from photos from eyewitnesses extracted from social media posts and their integration with established data. Due to the rapid availability of these posts compared to traditional data sources such as remote sensing data, areas affected by a flood, for example, can be determined quickly. The challenge is to filter the large number of posts to a manageable amount of potentially useful inundation-related information, as well as to interpret and integrate the posts into mapping procedures in a timely manner. To support rapid inundation mapping we propose a methodology and develop "PostDistiller", a tool to filter geolocated posts from social media services which include links to photos. This spatial distributed contextualized in situ information is further explored manually.

  abstract = {Bedload, the transport of sediment remaining in contact with the stream bed, has mainly been studied from the perspective of the correlation between fluid driving forces and the responding sediment flux. Yet grain\textendash grain interactions are important and bedload should also be considered as a granular phenomenon. We review progress made recently in the study of granular flows, especially on segregation and rheology, that better illuminates the nature of bedload. Granular flows may exhibit gas-like or fluid-like flow, or quasi-solid deformation. All three conditions might be duplicated in bedload. Understanding of intense bedload transport occurring continuously in a layer several grains deep \textendash{} typical of sand beds \textendash{} might greatly benefit from results in granular physics, as illustrated by grain-inspired bedload results. However, processes restricted to the surface of the bed, when particles move intermittently and the bed becomes structured, while characteristic in gravel-bed channels, are not well addressed in granular physics. Mutual study of these phenomena may benefit both physics and fluvial geomorphology. We intend, therefore, to contribute to an enhanced dialogue between granular physics and bedload science communities.},

  doi = {10.3929/ethz-b-000221064},
  abstract = {Worldwide, many rivers are affected by various river engineering measures and exhibit ecological deficits as a result. Sediment input from upstream is often limited by the presence of hydropower plants, sediment retention basins, and other river training measures, resulting in a lack of bed-load and morphological degradation. Sediment deficit can undermine structures, negatively influence groundwater formation, and decrease habitat quality for aquatic flora and fauna. Sediment replenishment by means of artificial gravel deposits or enhanced by bank erosion are two options when attempting to compensate for sediment deficits in rivers and to improve their ecological conditions. The ability to predict bank erosion rates and their impact on the river reach are important when attempting to implement restoration projects successfully.  In the first part of this study, experiments are conducted on the erosion pattern of artificial gravel deposits to (i) investigate the influence of the governing parameters on the erosion process of gravel deposits, (ii) improve understanding of fluvial bank erosion in case of non-cohesive, granular bank material, and (iii) identify the fundamentals  to implement and improve bank erosion in numerical models. In a second test series, the ability of non-submerged structures to enhance bank erosion is evaluated. Erodible and non-erodible structures are tested to obtain bank erosion volumes that are favourable from river engineering and ecological perspectives. In a third test series, the long-term evolution of the bed of a typical Swiss river as a result of changing sediment supply is investigated. Predicting equations intended to describe the erosion pattern of artificial gravel deposits and to estimate the backwater rise that occurs due to gravel deposits are proposed. This study demonstrates that an excess shear stress relation can describe the temporal evolution of the mean erosion rate of an artificial gravel deposit.  Non-erodible structures perpendicular to a river's bank and groins on the opposite bank are efficient to enhance bank erosion for discharges where no or negligible bank erosion occurs without a structure being present. The introduction of large wood debris jams is a promising option for enhancing bank erosion, as this approach combines low maintenance requirements with the immediate creation of complex habitats. In the third test series, channel responses to a long-term change in sediment supply took the form of a combination of (i) an adjustment on the grain scale by a smoothening of the bed; (ii) a change of the cross-sectional shape by sediment deposition, primarily in the thalweg; and (iii) and a reduction of the longitudinal bed slope.  This study's findings allow for improved predictions of the rate and magnitude of bank erosion and their subsequent impact on the downstream river reach; thus, they can consequently aid in determining design frequency and deposit volumes for planned restoration projects.},

  abstract = {Fundamental transitions in natural resources technologies, institutions, and management approaches are often difficult to see in advance, or even in the midst, of actual changes. Such a transformation now appears to be underway for freshwater resources, driven by increasingly severe water-related crises around the world. These include mismatches between supply and demand; the continued failure to meet basic human needs for water and sanitation; expanding ecological degradation due to extraction of water from natural systems and human-caused climate changes; the development of new technologies for using, treating, monitoring, and reporting on water use; new conceptual work; and growing attention given to water issues by the public and scientific communities. Similar transitions, with additional implications for water, also appear to be underway in the energy and climate fields. For such transitions to be successful, it is important to understand what drives deep changes in the perceptions, management, and use of natural resources; the factors that encourage or discourage changes; and whether strategies can be developed to improve and accelerate those changes that lead to social, economic, and environmental sustainability goals. This paper addresses the concept of resource or environmental transitions in the context of freshwater; reviews theories, data, and frameworks for identifying and analyzing transitions; offers some examples; and identifies key policies to help manage effective and successful transitions.},

  abstract = {The fact that bedload transport is an inherently time-variant and location-sensitive fluvial process was revealed by systematic sampling, nine decades ago. Subsequent stream-wide measurements, that frequently incorporated lengthy collection periods, as well as the adoption of standardized sampling procedures, averaged out some temporal and spatial variability. However, continuous, highly resolved, long-period records of transport activity generated by active and passive bedload monitoring on diverse rivers have recently brought this variability into sharp focus. A defining characteristic of these `big data' is that there are many possible bedload transport rates for each discharge and a wide range of discharges associated with each transport rate. Crucially, this incoherent scatter, which is generated by the various factors that affect bedload transport, can no longer be viewed as `noise' that can be averaged out. We demonstrate that, even for small datasets, different methods of reporting and analysing bedload transport records provide different perspectives on the bedload transport rate\textendash flow relation. The inclusion/exclusion of zero values, present in all data that capture the intermittent nature of bedload transport, also affects the relation. To unlock the potential of big data and facilitate the development of bedload transport\textendash flow relations from field measurements, it is essential to employ modes of analysis that are robust to outliers and do not assume that associations between the independent and dependent variables are the same at all levels.},

It is used as a validation case of its capability to reproduce flow and bed changes in this steep and laterally unconfined case with coarse sediment. The numerical model used a fractional transport approach enabling to compute grain size sorting and segregation processes. The fractional transport rates were computed with Meyer-Peter Muller equation. Water depth was computed with the ``variable power equation'' developed by Ferguson to account for both low, intermediate and high submergence (depth/grain size). Comparison of the numerical and physical models was done qualitatively (based on animations of the numerical results compared to videos of the physical model) and quantitatively computing an indicator of ratio of active channels (i.e., transporting sediment) measured using the large scale image velocimetry technique applied to time-lapse videos. The results show that fractional transport in itself does not bring significant improvement. However, dramatic improvements of the modelled channelization pattern and dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively, emerged when coupling the fractional transport with the friction law (through the active layer D84). In essence, when computing local grain size, it should be taken into account in the hydraulics too. This approach is a step forward to achieve better predictions of flow and channel dynamics on unconfined active morphologies and depositional systems.},

As a result, it is ripe for reenvisioning in the light of the emergence of meter-scale, spatially explicit data and algorithmic geospatial analysis. This study developed and evaluated a new spatially explicit method for analyzing discharge-dependent hydraulics coined \dbend hydraulic topography\dbend{} that not only increases accuracy but also eliminates several sample- and assumption-based inconsistencies. Using data and hydrodynamic simulations from the regulated, gravel\dbend cobble-bed lower Yuba River in California, power functions were fitted to discharge-dependent average width, depth, and depth-weighted velocity for three spatial scales and then their corresponding exponents and coefficients were compared across scales and against ones computed using traditional approaches. Average hydraulic values from cross sections at the segment scale spanned up to 1.5 orders of magnitude for a given discharge. Transect-determined exponents for reach-scale depth and velocity relations were consistently over- and underestimated, respectively, relative to the hydraulic topography benchmark. Overall, 73\% of cross-sectional power regression parameters assessed fell between 10 and 50 absolute percent error with respect to the spatially explicit hydraulic topography baseline. Although traditional transect-based sampling may be viable for certain uses, percent errors of this magnitude could compromise engineering applications in river management and training works.},

The method combines three concepts: (1) that differentiation enhances the high frequency portion of a signal, (2) that the expected maximum of a random series is given by the Universal threshold, and (3) that good data cluster in a dense cloud in phase space or Poincar\'e maps. These concepts are used to construct an ellipsoid in three-dimensional phase space, then points lying outside the ellipsoid are designated as spikes. The new method is shown to have superior performance to various other methods and it has the added advantage that it requires no parameters. Several methods for replacing sequences of spurious data are presented. A polynomial fitted to good data on either side of the spike event, then interpolated across the event, is preferred by the authors.},

We identified locations with upwelling and downwelling fluxes of HWE as well as ambiguous hydraulic contact between groundwater and surface water along the river. In these locations, we sampled bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates. In total, 627 individuals of benthic macroinvertebrates of 34 taxa were identified. We revealed that bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrate fauna is more abundant and diverse in river stretches where water from the river infiltrates the hyporheic zone. Results also show higher taxonomic richness and abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates in stretches with diagnosed infiltrating conditions (downwelling flux in a hyporheic zone) compared to in stretches where the river drained groundwater (upwelling flux in a hyporheic zone), but the recorded differences were not statistically significant.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic and geomorphic classifications have gained traction in response to the increasing need for basin-wide water resources management. Regardless of the selected classification scheme, an open scientific challenge is how to extend information from limited field sites to classify tens of thousands to millions of channel reaches across a basin. To address this spatial scaling challenge, this study leverages machine learning to predict reach-scale geomorphic channel types using publicly available geospatial data. A bottom-up machine learning approach selects the most accurate and stable model among 20,000 combinations of 287 coarse geospatial predictors, preprocessing methods, and algorithms in a three-tiered framework to (i) define a tractable problem and reduce predictor noise, (ii) assess model performance in statistical learning, and (iii) assess model performance in prediction. This study also addresses key issues related to the design, interpretation, and diagnosis of machine learning models in hydrologic sciences. In an application to the Sacramento River basin (California, USA), the developed framework selects a Random Forest model to predict 10 channel types previously determined from 290 field surveys over 108,943 two hundred-meter reaches. Performance in statistical learning is reasonable with a 61\% median cross-validation accuracy, a sixfold increase over the 10\% accuracy of the baseline random model, and the predictions coherently capture the large-scale geomorphic organization of the landscape. Interestingly, in the study area, the persistent roughness of the topography partially controls channel types and the variation in the entropy-based predictive performance is explained by imperfect training information and scale mismatch between labels and predictors.},

  abstract = {Vegetation structure is an important biodiversity indicator providing biological and physical environment that supports and maintains forest biodiversity. The airborne lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) systems have the advantage of directly measuring three-dimensional vegetation structure, and have been widely used in wildlife habitat mapping and species distribution modeling at the local scales. As lidar data are increasingly compiled into broad spatial coverage, the development of structural inventory and indicators to categorize habitat types and identify important patches would be beneficial to regional-level conservation planning and biodiversity monitoring. However, this area of research has not been adequately explored. Large-area mapping of critical habitat patches is also a fundamental step towards modeling habitat connectivity. Quantification and dynamic modeling of habitat connectivity under long-term influence of land cover change events provide insights into forest management and conservation planning, and including climate change constraints into the modeling framework also helps maintain ecosystem integrity and improve conservation effectiveness. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis are to 1) characterize vegetation structure and identify important habitat patches with critical structural traits using regional lidar dataset, and 2) build habitat networks to model connectivity dynamics under land cover change events. To do this, first, a novel approach using cluster analysis to process large-area lidar data into categorical classes representing natural groupings of habitat structure was applied to derive eight unique structure classes in the managed forested area in Alberta, Canada. Second, the structure classes indicating high levels of structure complexity combined with Landsat-derived forest cover types were used to identify important habitat patches to develop habitat networks. Lastly, spatial prioritization schemes based on different aspects of connectivity and climate constraints were generated and implemented through scenario-based simulations of land cover change events. Connectivity dynamics through the simulations were assessed and compared between scenarios. The result showed that the conservation strategies considering both habitat area and habitat spatial configuration were best at maintaining habitat connectivity, and taking climate constraints into consideration didn't affect overall connectivity. Overall, this research provides an integrated approach to characterize habitat structure using large-area lidar data for dynamic connectivity modeling following land cover change simulations.},

Most obviously, ecosystems can provide us with material things that are essential for our daily lives, such as food, wood, wool and medicines. Although the other types of benefit we get from ecosystems are easily overlooked, they also play an important role in regulating the environments in which we live. They can help ensure the flow of clean water and protect us from flooding or other hazards like soil erosion, land-slips and tsunamis. They can contribute to our spiritual well-being, through their cultural or religious significance or the opportunities they provide for recreation and the enjoyment of nature.In this chapter, we will look at the goods and services that ecosystems can provide and the role that biodiversity may play in producing them, specifically the contribution that biodiversity makes to people's livelihoods, to their security and to their health. In other words, we will concentrate mainly on the utilitarian value of biodiversity. We will also explore how these ideas link up with those of the Ecosystem Approach to environmental management and policy, and some of the implications of this for how sustainable development is defined.},

  abstract = {Living in an aquatic environment, often devoid of light but rich in dissolved compounds, fish have highly developed chemosensory and chemical signalling systems. The olfactory and gustatory systems comprise the major chemosensory pathways. Despite considerable variations in structural organization of the peripheral olfactory organ throughout fish species, ultrastructural organization of the olfactory sensory epithelium is extremely consistent. The olfactory receptor cell is a bipolar neurone which is directly exposed to the external environment and sends information to the brain by its own axon (cranial nerve I). Four major classes of chemicals have been identified as specific olfactory stimuli and their stimulatory effectiveness characterized: amino acids, sex steroids, bile acids/salts and prostaglandins. Olfactory signals such as those involved in reproduction and feeding may be processed independently through two distinct subsystems: the lateral and medial olfactory systems. The taste buds constitute the structural basis of the gustatory organ. Taste buds may occur not only in the oropharyngeal cavity, but on the whole body surface. Chemical information detected by specialized epithelial cells, gustatory cells, is transmitted to the central nervous system by cranial nerve VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), and X (vagal). Besides diverse sensitivities and specificities for amino acids, fish gustatory receptors detect various organic acids, nucleotides and bile salts. Putative receptors, molecular mechanisms of transduction and the role played by olfaction and gustation in feeding, reproduction, migration and other fish behaviours are discussed.},

  abstract = {Numerical models of landscape evolution are playing an increasingly important role in providing an improved understanding of geomorphic transport processes shaping Earth\dbend s surface topography. Improving theoretical underpinnings coupled with increasing computational capacity has led to the development of several open source codes written in low-level languages. However, adapting these codes to new functionality or introducing greater flexibility often requires significant recoding. Here we present a multi-process, scalable, numerical model of geomorphological evolution, built with a modular structure and geared toward seamless extensibility. We implement recent algorithmic advances that reduce the computational cost of flow routing \dbend\dbend a problem that typically scales quadratically with the number of unknowns \dbend\dbend to linear in time while allowing for parallel implementations of geomorphic transport processes. Our scalability tests demonstrate that such parallelizations can achieve an order of magnitude speedup on a typical desktop computer, making large-scale simulations more tractable.},

  abstract = {Major river and flash flood events have accumulated in Central and Eastern Europe over the last decade reminding the public as well as the insurance sector that climate related risks are likely to become even more damaging and prevalent as climate patterns change. However, information about current and future hydro-climatic extremes is often not available. The Future Danube Model (FDM) is an end-user driven multi-hazard and risk model suite for the Danube region that has been developed to provide climate services related to perils such as heavy precipitation, heat waves, floods, and droughts under recent and scenario conditions. As a result, it provides spatially consistent information on extreme events and natural resources throughout the entire Danube catchment. It can be used to quantify climate risks, to support the implementation of the EU framework directives, for climate informed urban and land use planning, water resources management, and for climate proofing of large scale infrastructural planning including cost benefit analysis. The model suite consists of five individual and exchangeable modules: a weather and climate module, a hydrological module, a risk module, an adaptation module, and a web-based visualization module. They are linked in such a way that output from one module can either be used standalone or fed into subsequent modules. The utility of the tool has been tested by experts and stakeholders. The results show that more and more intense hydrological extremes are likely to occur under climate scenario conditions, e.g. higher order floods may occur more frequently.},

  abstract = {Summary The three-dimensional numerical model SSIIM was used to compute suspended sediment distribution and deposition pattern in a hydropower reservoir. The study also included three-dimensional measurements of suspended sediments in the reservoir using the LISST-SL instrument. The measurement device is based on a laser-diffraction method and measures concentrations and grain size distributions instantly. It was applied to 25 locations in the reservoir where vertical profiles were taken. The measurements and computed results were compared and reasonable agreement was found. In addition, computed bed elevation changes were compared with measured values in the conducted study. The results of the numerical model agree well with the bed levels taken by echo sounding. The numerical model SSIIM solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier\textendash Stokes equations in three dimensions and uses an adaptive grid which moves in accordance to changes in the water and bed levels. The suspended sediment transport is calculated by solving the convection\textendash diffusion equation and the bed load transport by an empirical formula. The used implicit free-water surface algorithm provides the possibility of using large time step sizes, which makes a simulation of an operation year on a desktop PC possible.},

Methods that identify areas prone to piping erosion at the regional scale are limited. The main objective of this research is to develop a novel modeling approach by using three machine learning algorithms\dbend mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), and support vector machine (SVM) in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to map susceptibility to piping erosion in the loess-covered hilly region of Golestan Province, Northeast Iran. In this research, we have used 22 geo-environmental indices/factors and 345 identified pipes as predictors and dependent variables. The piping susceptibility maps were assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Validation of the results showed that the AUC for the three mentioned algorithms varied from 90.32\% to 92.45\%. We concluded that the proposed approach could efficiently produce a piping susceptibility map.},

  abstract = {River bank stabilization is a common practise and can be observed on most rivers around the world, often using hard-engineering riprap. Increasingly, bioengineered approaches using vegetation-based constructive materials is promoted to alleviate some of the negative ecological stresses of bank stabilization. Because these stabilization projects use a variety of techniques to create a site-specific design, they can have unexpected morphological implications and variable ecological benefits which can be anticipated using numerical modelling. Bioengineered bank stabilization creates roughness elements on both micro and macro scales, where only macro-roughness can be captured by bathymetric adjustments. The definition of micro- and macro-roughness depends on the spatial resolution of the model domain, and may be considered analogous to skin and form friction when characterizing natural alluvial bed environments. The objectives of this research are to assess the hydrodynamic impact of the added micro- and macro-roughness associated with a bioengineering pilot project planned in Quebec, Canada and to use this case study to propose new techniques for integrating increased roughness due to bank stabilization into numerical models. The roughness of the stabilization project is assessed by adjusting bathymetry to simulate macro-roughness features, and roughness coefficients to simulate micro-roughness features. Results show a significant dampening interaction term that reduced the cumulative effect on resistance to flow when both roughness types were applied.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the clogging of fine sediments within gravel substrates is advanced through use of dimensional analysis and macroanalysis of previously conducted clogging experiments in hydraulic flumes. Dimensional analysis via the Buckingham pi theorem is used to suggest that the dimensionless clogging depth can be potentially collapsed using the original and adjusted bed-to-grain ratios, i.e.,~ratio of substrate diameter to fine sediment diameter, substrate porosity, roughness Reynolds number, and Peclet number. Macroanalysis and statistical analysis is performed using 10 previously published studies that include a total of 146 different test conditions reporting noncohesive, fine sediment clogging, or deposition in porous gravel-beds with hydraulically rough turbulent open channel flow. Results suggest that the adjusted bed-to-grain ratio is a reliable predictor of the initiation of clogging with clogging occurring below 27 for the fine fluvial sediment clogging in a gravel bed substrate for hydraulically rough turbulent flow flumes considered. The original and adjusted bed-to-grain ratios show little influence on the depth of clogging once the lower threshold for bed filling is reached. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the bed-to-grain ratio is not used to predict the maximum depth of clogging. Rather, results suggest that the dimensionless clogging depth can be collapsed using the substrate porosity and roughness Reynolds number reflecting the impact of the pore water velocity distribution on the dispersion of fine sediment into the gravel substrate. The clogging depth results are used to estimate the clogging profile for fine sands in gravel substrate for the datasets.},

  abstract = {Fisheries and aquaculture production, imports, exports and equitability of distribution determine the supply of aquatic food to people. Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand.},

  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  abstract = {There is a long research history addressing olfactory imprinting, natal homing, and non-natal straying by anadromous salmon and trout (Salmonidae). In undisturbed populations, adult straying is a fundamental component of metapopulation biology, facilitating genetic resilience, demographic stability, recolonization, and range expansion into unexploited habitats. Unfortunately, salmonid hatcheries and other human actions worldwide have affected straying in ways that can negatively affect wild populations through competitive interactions, reduced productivity and resiliency, hybridization and domestication effects, and outbreeding depression. Reduced adult straying is therefore an objective for many managed populations. Currently, there is considerable uncertainty about the range of `natural' stray rates and about which mechanisms precipitate straying in either wild or human-influenced fish. Research in several disciplines indicates that adult straying is affected by endocrine physiology and neurological processes in juveniles, incomplete or interrupted imprinting during rearing and emigration, and by complex interactions among adult maturation processes, reproductive behaviors, olfactory memory, environmental conditions during migration, and senescence physiology. Reported salmonid stray rates indicate that the behavior varies among species, among life-history types, and among populations within species. Most strays enter sites near natal areas, but long-distance straying also occurs, especially in hatchery populations that were outplanted or transported as juveniles. A majority of past studies has estimated straying as demographic losses from donor populations, but some have estimated straying into recipient populations. Most recipient-based estimates have substantiated concerns that wild populations are vulnerable to swamping by abundant hatchery and farm-raised strays.},

  abstract = {Vertical mixing plays a major role in functioning of seasonally stratified aquatic systems. In this study, we employ a 1-D stratification model and a 9 year forcing data set to simulate the thermal dynamics in a large, but shallow reservoir that regularly displays a polymictic character with complete mixing events during summer. Such mixing dynamics is typical for many water bodies in the temperate zone having an intermediate depth. In many cases summer-mixing events were documented to induce severe water quality deteriorations (e.g., cyanobacterial blooms). We examined and quantified the response of summer-mixing behavior to combinations of hydrological regimes, i.e., water level fluctuations and withdrawal depth, and changes in meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature and wind speed. According to our findings: (i) increasing summer air temperatures considerably increase the resistance of the water column against mixing; (ii) while the combination of maintenance of a high and constant water depth and implementation of epilimnetic discharge results in almost complete resistance to mixing, their individual effects are also substantial, being roughly comparable to the effects of 4\textendash 6 K increase in air temperatures; (iii) wind is a critical variable, 30\% increase of which can compensate up to 5.5 K increase in air temperatures; and (iv) effects of changes in air temperature, wind speed, and water depth are inter-dependent, as indicated by enhanced importance of wind and temperature in response to decreasing water depth, as well as reduced importance of depth in response to decreasing wind speed and increasing temperature.},

  abstract = {1. This study summarises our development and application in developing countries of a process for assessing the ecological, social and economic costs and benefits of water-resource developments, as an aid to basin planning. 2. During 15 years of work in Africa and Asia, the process sequentially included the whole river ecosystem and the whole flow regime in the assessment; used a multidisciplinary team and a scenario-based approach that gave equal weighting to the ecological, social, resource-economic and macro-economic costs and benefits of development; quantified or semi-quantified the costs and benefits in data-poor situations, capturing expert opinion and local wisdom as well as data; recognised that the final allocation of water for ecosystem maintenance should be a societal choice of trade-offs between resource protection and development. 3. Flow assessments were increasingly done at the basin rather than project level and introduced the concept and practicality of Development Space as a tool to aid basin planning. 4. Later assessments included valuation of regulating, cultural and provisioning services provided by rivers as part of the cost-benefit analysis. 5. Implementation of managed flows as outlined above is a complex and long-term process that should include a number of major steps, from development of the appropriate legislation to monitoring of management decisions and adaptive management. Country or region-wide implementation at this scale could well take one to two decades, even where the political will and technical skills exist. 6. We conclude by offering eight principles that we believe would promote genuinely sustainable use of rivers.},

  abstract = {An Erratum has been published for this article in River Research and Applications 21(5) 2005, 509. Sustainable use of river ecosystems requires that they be managed holistically. This paper describes an holistic methodology, DRIFT (Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation), for advising on environmental flows for rivers targetted for water-management activities. DRIFT's basic philosophy is that all major abiotic and biotic components constitute the ecosystem to be managed; and within that, the full spectrum of flows, and their temporal and spatial variability, constitute the flows to be managed. The methodology employs experienced scientists from the following biophysical disciplines: hydrology, hydraulics, fluvial geomorphology, sedimentology, chemistry, botany and zoology. Where there are subsistence users of the river, the following socio-economic disciplines are also employed: sociology, anthropology, water supply, public health, livestock health and resource economics. DRIFT is a structured process for combining data and knowledge from all the disciplines to produce flow-related scenarios for water managers to consider. It consists of four modules. In the first, or biophysical module, the river ecosystem is described and predictive capacity developed on how it would change with flow changes. In the second, or socio-economic module, links are described between riparian people who are subsistence users of river resources, the resources they use, and their health. The objective is to develop predictive capacity of how river changes would impact their lives. In the third module, scenarios are built of potential future flows and the impacts of these on the river and the riparian people. The fourth, or economic module, lists compensation and mitigation costs. DRIFT should run in parallel with two other exercises which are external to it: a macro-economic assessment of the wider implications of each scenario, and a Public Participation Process whereby people other than subsistence users can indicate the level of acceptability of each scenario. DRIFT has been developed in a semi-arid, developing region, where water-supply problems are pressing, and uncertainties about river-linked ecological and social processes high. The use of DRIFT in this context is discussed. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Hutchinson and L\"offler's (1956) classification of lakes based on the seasonal thermal mixing regime has become a cornerstone of any analysis of lakes as elements of the earth surface. Until now however the lake classification has lacked a physically sound quantitative criterion distinguishing between two fundamental lake types: thermally stratified during a large portion of the year (mono- and dimictic) and predominantly mixed to the bottom (polymictic). Using the mechanistic balance between potential and kinetic energy we review the different formulations of the Richardson number to derive a generalized scaling for seasonal stratification in a closed lake basin. The scaling parameter is the critical mean basin depth, Hcrit, that delineates lakes that mix regularly from those that stratify seasonally based on lake water transparency, lake length, and an annual mean estimate for the Monin-Obukhov length. We validate the scaling on available data of lakes worldwide using logistic regression. The scaling criterion consistently described the mixing regime significantly better than either the conventional unbounded basin scaling or a simple depth threshold. Thus, the generalized scaling is universal for freshwater lakes and allows the seasonal mixing regime to be estimated without numerically solving the heat transport equations.},

The entrainment and deposition depth of the sediment depend on dune trough levels below the average bed level and therefore on the dune height. As bedload sediment transport depends partly on grain size, it will be dependent upon the relict vertical sorting left in the bed by former discharge waves. The vertical sorting is created by sorting in grain flows on the lee side of dunes and by gravel lag formation in the dune troughs. Based on these principles, a simple reach-representative process model is developed for the prediction of bed sediment reworking, vertical sorting and deposition by dunes. The model is applied to two successive discharge waves of different magnitude, and predicts qualitatively the same vertical sorting characteristics as observed in the vibracores from the River Rhine (The Netherlands) after two successive discharge waves. The effect of the sorting on the sediment transport, and how to include this feedback in future models, is discussed.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic river models in combination with physical habitat modelling serve as the basis for a wide spectrum of environmental studies. Larvae, juvenile and spawning fish, redds and benthic invertebrates belong to the biological groups most heavily affected by rapid flow variations as a consequence of peaking energy production, or \dbend hydropeaking\dbend. As these species find their preferential habitat to a great extent in shallow regions, high prediction accuracy for these areas is essential to substantiate the use of hydrodynamic models. In this paper, a new formulation for the depth-dependent roughness originating from the boundary layer theory is derived. The modelling approach is based on the concept of a dynamic, spatio-temporal Manning's roughness which allows for considerable improvement in the accuracy of stationary and highly transient hydrodynamic simulations in shallow river areas. In addition, the approach facilitates more effective model calibration, as it allows for the preservation of the roughness sublayer thickness as a single calibration parameter for the entire range of hydropeaking discharges. The approach is tested and validated on a 7.5km long stretch of a middle-size gravel river affected by hydropeaking. Model results using conventional constant roughness and the proposed dynamic roughness approaches are compared. The implications for the stationary habitat assessment and calculation of dynamic hydropeaking parameters are analysed as well.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to model the hydrodynamic processes of the Istanbul Strait with its stratified flow characteristics, and calibrate the most important parameters using local and global search algorithms. For that, two open boundary conditions are defined, which are in the northern and southern parts of the Strait. Observed bathymetric, hydrographic, meteorological, and water-level data are used to set up the Delft3D-FLOW model. First, the sensitivities of the model parameters on the numerical model outputs are assessed using Parameter EStimation Tool (PEST) toolbox. Then, the model is calibrated based on the objective functions, focusing on the flow rates of the upper and lower layers. The salinity and temperature profiles of the strait are only used for model validation. The results show that the calibrated model outputs of the Istanbul Strait are reliable and consistent with the in situ measurements. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the spatial low-pass filter coefficient, horizontal eddy viscosity, Prandtl\textendash Schmidt number, slope in log\textendash log spectrum, and Manning roughness coefficient are most sensitive parameters affecting the flow rate performance of the model. The agreement between observed salinity profiles and simulated model outputs is promising, whereas the match between observed and simulated temperature profiles is weak, showing that the model can be improved, particularly for simulating the mixing layer.},

The habitat utilization data were used to develop habitat suitability functions that provide input variables to the instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) habitat assessment model of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Observations of habitat utilization of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were obtained during the summer months of 1983 and 1984. The observations were made in small streams with discharges ranging from 0.7 m3 s-1 to 0.03 m3 s-1. The streams are at elevations of 1250 to 2530 m. Equal effort was applied to observing undisturbed trout in all habitat types. Snorkeling proved to be the most effective method of observation. Individual trout of all species and life stages were most often observed in the lower half of the water column, utilizing low-velocity currents of less than 3.0 cm s-1. From the depth and velocity utilization data, several forms of habitat suitability functions were developed and evaluated: 1 Univariate depth and velocity functions derived from frequency histogram analysis. 2 Univariate depth and univariate velocity exponential polynomial models. 3 Bivariate depth and velocity exponential polynomial models. Univariate exponential polynomial models provided the best fit to the data for each species, based on visual comparisons of response surfaces and contour plots, and comparisons of computed sums of squared errors. Bivariate models fitted to the data resulted in greater sums of squared errors than multiplicative aggragation of univariate models, and frequently predicted utilization at zero depth. The habitat suitability functions derived from the univariate exponential polynomial models provided the best input to the IFIM habitat assessment models.},

We propose \emph{GRAINet}, a data-driven approach to analyze grain size distributions of entire gravel bars based on georeferenced UAV images. A convolutional neural network is trained to regress grain size distributions as well as the characteristic mean diameter from raw images. \emph{GRAINet} allows the holistic analysis of entire gravel bars, resulting in (i) high-resolution maps of the spatial grain size distribution at large scale, and (ii) robust grading curves for entire gravel bars. To collect a large training dataset of 1,491 samples, we introduce \emph{digital line sampling} as a new annotation strategy, following the widely applied line sampling analysis of Fehr (1987). Our evaluation on 25 gravel bars along 6 different rivers in Switzerland yields high accuracy: The resulting maps of mean diameters have a mean absolute error of 1.1\&thinsp;cm, with no bias. Robust grading curves for entire gravel bars can be extracted if representative training data is available. At the gravel bar level the MAE error of the predicted mean diameter is even reduced to 0.3\&thinsp;cm. Extensive experiments were carried out to study the quality of the digital line samples, the generalization capability of \emph{GRAINet} to new locations, the model performance w.r.t. human labeling noise, the limitations of the current model, and the potential of \emph{GRAINet} to analyze images with low resolutions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Riverine fish stranding is of significant concern due to its potentially devastating impacts on fish populations already at risk. Because stranding is dependent on a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, it is difficult to accurately identify and parameterize fish stranding risks for various river topographies, fish species/lifestages and flow ramping scenarios. This article presents a literature review, new concepts and a novel Python3 algorithm for post-processing two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model results to identify spatially explicit locations where fish stranding is likely, such as but not limited to downstream of hydropeaking facilities. Compared to previous stranding algorithms, this one is novel in its use of graph theory to find optimal fish escape routes and for its embedding in the free, open-source river analysis software River Architect. Guided by biological parameter selection and supplied with two-dimensional hydrodynamic model rasters, River Architect's Stranding Risk module is suitable for characterization of existing pool stranding risks, alternative flow regime and topographic design evaluation and post-project assessment of rivers during flow recessions.},

  abstract = {The field of citizen science is a rapidly evolving type of scientific research focussing on the collaboration of motivated volunteers (citizen scientists) with professional scientists to generate new knowledge and information. In recent years, there has been a steady growth of Earth Science related citizen science projects that aim to build knowledge, awareness and ultimately resilience to key local- to global-scale environmental issues (e.g., geohazards, environmental monitoring). In addition, there has also been progression from small pilot studies to large data collection Earth Science citizen science initiatives that are used to underpin modelling. However, despite this, numerous operational and strategic challenges exist and whilst the awareness of citizen science has improved markedly, it is clear that the direct impact of citizen science on policy and decision making is still limited. Within this paper, we review these challenges alongside defining citizen science itself, and its benefits. The range of methods and applications of citizen science are explored through a series of case studies centred on geohazards, observations \& classification, multi-topic, and education/outreach. The paper also explores future citizen science opportunities within Earth Science.},

Design and optimization of trawl-doors using computational models are a key factor in minimizing the fuel consumption. This paper presents an optimization algorithm for the shape design of trawl-door shapes using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. Accurate CFD models are computationally expensive. Therefore, the direct use of traditional optimization algorithms, which often require a large number of evaluations, may be prohibitive. The proposed approach is iterative and uses low-order local response surface approximation models of the expensive CFD model, constructed in each iteration, to reduce the number of evaluations. The algorithm is applied to the design of a multi-element trawl-doors, involving up to four design variables controlling the angle of attack and the slat and flap position and orientation. The results show that a satisfactory design can be obtained at the cost of a few iterations of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Water age and thermal structure of Lake Mead were modeled using the 3-dimensional hydrodynamic Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). The model was calibrated using observed data from 2005 and then applied to simulate 2 scenarios: high-stage with an initial water level of 370.0 m and low-stage with a projected initial water level of 320.0 m. The high-stage simulation described predrought lake hydrodynamics, while the low-stage simulation projected how lake circulation could respond under significant lake drawdown, should drought conditions persist. The results indicate that water level drawdown plays an important role in thermal stratification and water movement of Lake Mead during receding water levels. The impact of the dropping water level on lake thermal stratification is more significant in shallow regions such as Las Vegas Bay. Depth-averaged (the mean value of 30 vertical layers) water temperature in the low-stage was estimated to increase by 4\textendash 7 C and 2\textendash 4 C for shallow ({$<$}20 m) and deep ({$>$}70 m) regions, respectively. Further, depth-averaged water age decreased about 70\textendash 90 d for shallow regions and 90\textendash 120 d for deep regions under the simulated drought scenario. Such changes in temperature and water age due to continuous drought will have a strong influence on the hydrodynamic processes of Lake Mead. This study provides a numerical tool to support adaptive management of regional water resources by lake managers.},

  abstract = {Meandering is one of the unique processes in Earth surface dynamics. Since the 1960s, fluvial geomorphologists have generalized numerous widely-acknowledged empirical or semi-empirical formulae to describe meandering rivers' characteristics. The most frequently applied one is the Kinoshita high-sinuosity curve to describe meander channel planform geometry. Combining the Kinoshita curve with the Beck equations to describe the riverbed topography at equilibrium state, a prototype of a synthetic riverbed topography generating model is made for idealized meandering rivers. Such a method can be readily extended and applied to arbitrary meandering rivers in the real world, resulting in the synthetic riverbed topography model, pyRiverBed, presented herein. A meander migration and neck cutoff submodel is also embedded in pyRiverBed. Unlike existing linear and non-linear bend theory-based models, pyRiverbed aims towards generating the riverbed topography for each snapshot during the migration process. The present model can facilitate meandering river researchers to interpolate their field-measured bathymetric data using the synthetic bed, design their non-flat bed laboratory flumes for experiments, and initialize their hydrodynamic and morphodynamic numerical models. It can also provide guidance in stream restoration projects on designing a channel with a morphodynamic equilibrium bed. The quality of generated synthetic bed topography is evaluated through the comparison against both laboratory experiment data and field-measured data. The meander migration submodel is validated using a real-world channel migration and neck cutoff event. The validation results prove that the synthetic riverbed's accuracy is reasonably good, and the meander migration submodel can successfully predict meander migration and neck cutoff.},

  abstract = {Incubating salmonid eggs in streambeds are often threatened by deposition of fine sediment within the gravel. To relate sedimentation of spawning gravel beds to sediment transport, infiltration of fine sediment ({$<$}2 mm in diameter) into clean gravel beds, bed material size distributions, scour-fill depths, and sediment transport during 10 storm flow events were measured in three streams of north coastal California. Although suspended sediment comprised most (75\textendash 94\%) of the clastic load during storm flows, bed load material (0.25\textendash 2 mm) accounted for most (70\textendash 78\%) of the fine sediment accumulated in experimental gravel implanted in the streambeds. Sand trapped in the interstices of the top several centimeters formed a seal that impeded deeper deposition of very fine sand and finer material. The seal was responsible at least in part for a decrease in the rate of fine-sediment accumulation with increasing cumulative bed load transport. Areas of the streambeds commonly scoured or filled 0.1 m or more during storm flows, and thus scour and fill commonly created a sandy layer at least as thick as the seal formed by sediment infiltration. Scour could erode eggs laid in the bed and expose deeper levels of the bed to infiltration by fine sediment, but at the same time could allow fine sediment to be winnowed away. Great temporal and spatial variation in sedimentation in these streams suggests that individual storms of moderate size pose a threat to eggs in many but not all areas selected by fish for spawning.},

  abstract = {Ground-water and surface flow depletions are altering riparian ecosystems throughout the southwestern United States, and have contributed to the decline of forests of the pioneer trees Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) and Salix gooddingii (Goodding willow). On some rivers, these forests have been replaced by shrublands of Tamarix ramosissima (tamarisk), a drought-tolerant species from Eurasia. The physiological response of these three riparian plant species to decreases in water availability is well studied, but little attention has been given to shifts in community and population structure in response to declines in surface flow and ground-water levels. Based on study of 17 sites spanning a hydrologic gradient, this research identified hydrologic thresholds above which P. fremontii\dbend S. gooddingii maintain tall dense stands with diverse age classes, and above which they are more abundant than T. ramosissima stands along the San Pedro River in Arizona. Surface flow permanence was the hydrologic variable that explained most of the variance in species abundance and relative importance, with inter-annual ground-water fluctuation and depth to ground water also contributing. P. fremontii and S. gooddingii were dominant over T. ramosissima at sites where surface flow was present more than 76\% of the time, inter-annual ground-water fluctuation was less than 0.5 m, and average maximum depth to ground water was less than 2.6 m, during a two-year period of data collection. Because T. ramosissima is a shrub species with smaller leaves and lower canopy heights than P. fremontii and S. gooddingii, these shifts in species composition corresponded to decreases in maximum canopy height and upper stratum (above 8 m) vegetation volume as site water availability declined. As well, sites with deeper water tables and more intermittent flows had greater areal coverage of shrublands and less of woodlands. The altered vegetation structure along dewatered rivers may lower wildlife habitat quality. This study provides river managers with quantitative hydrologic guidelines for conserving tall dense P. fremontii\dbend S. gooddingii stands and emphasizes the importance of maintaining long-term hydrologic conditions that are favorable to these species. The study also has implications for riparian restoration and invasive species management by suggesting that desired outcomes may be achieved through restoration of physical processes.},

The turbulent kinetic energy increased with increasing velocity and increasing solid volume fraction, but did not depend on stem diameter. The vegetation-generated turbulence dominated the total turbulence inside canopies. For the same sediment size, the critical turbulent kinetic energy at which resuspension was initiated was the same for both vegetated and bare beds, which resulted in a critical velocity that decreased with increasing solid volume fraction. Both the critical turbulence and critical velocity for resuspension had no dependence on stem diameter. However, for denser canopies and/or a canopy of smaller stem size, a greater energy slope is required to initiate resuspension. This study provides a way to predict the onset of resuspension in regions with vegetation, an important threshold for sediment transport and landscape evolution.},

  abstract = {One of the most important impacts of a future warmer climate is the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events. This increasing trend in extreme rainfall is seen in both the observational record and climate model projections. However, a thorough review of the recent scientific literature paints a complex picture in which the intensification of rainfall extremes depends on a multitude of factors. While some projected rainfall indices follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship scaling of an {$\sim$}7\%{$\sim$}7\%{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo form="prefix"{$>\sim<$}/mo{$><$}mn{$>$}7{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo{$>\%<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} increase in rainfall per 1\textdegree C of warming, there is substantial evidence that this scaling depends on rainfall extremes frequency, with longer return period events seeing larger increases, leading to super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling in some cases. The intensification of extreme rainfall events is now well documented at the daily scale but is less clear at the subdaily scale. In recent years, climate model simulations at a finer spatial and temporal resolution, including convection-permitting models, have provided more reliable projections of subdaily rainfall. Recent analyses indicate that rainfall scaling may also increase as a function of duration, such that shorter-duration, longer return period events will likely see the largest rainfall increases in a warmer climate. This has broad implications on the design and the use of rainfall intensity\textendash duration\textendash frequency (IDF) curves, for which both an overall increase in magnitude and a steepening can now be predicted. This paper also presents an overview of measures that have been adopted by various governing bodies to adapt IDF curves to the changing climate. Current measures vary from multiplying historical design rainfall by a simple constant percentage to modulating correction factors based on return periods and to scaling them to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship based on projected temperature increases. All of these current measures fail to recognize a possible super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of extreme rainfall and, perhaps more importantly, the increasing scaling toward shorter-duration rainfall and the most extreme rainfall events that will significantly impact stormwater runoff in cities and in small rural catchments. This paper discusses the remaining scientific gaps and offers technical recommendations for practitioners on how to adapt IDF curves to improve climate resilience.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that species extinctions jeopardize the functioning of ecosystems. Overfishing and other human influences are reducing the diversity and abundance of fish worldwide, but the ecosystem-level consequences of these changes have not been assessed quantitatively. Recycling of nutrients is one important ecosystem process that is directly influenced by fish. Fish species vary widely in the rates at which they excrete nitrogen and phosphorus; thus, altering fish communities could affect nutrient recycling. Here, we use extensive field data on nutrient recycling rates and population sizes of fish species in a Neotropical river and Lake Tanganyika, Africa, to evaluate the effects of simulated extinctions on nutrient recycling. In both of these species-rich ecosystems, recycling was dominated by relatively few species, but contributions of individual species differed between nitrogen and phosphorus. Alternative extinction scenarios produced widely divergent patterns. Loss of the species targeted by fishermen led to faster declines in nutrient recycling than extinctions in order of rarity, body size, or trophic position. However, when surviving species were allowed to increase after extinctions, these compensatory responses had strong moderating effects even after losing many species. Our results underscore the complexity of predicting the consequences of extinctions from species-rich animal communities. Nevertheless, the importance of exploited species in nutrient recycling suggests that overfishing could have particularly detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Fisheries are an essential ecosystem service, but catches from freshwaters are often overlooked. Hundreds of millions of people around the world benefit from low-cost protein, recreation, and commerce provided by freshwater fisheries, particularly in regions where alternative sources of nutrition and employment are scarce. Here, we derive a gridded global map of riverine fisheries and assess its implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. Catches increase with river discharge and human population density, and 90\% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Fish richness and catches are positively but not causally correlated, revealing that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. Merging our catch analysis with nutritional and socioeconomic data, we find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. Poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. The spatial coincidence of productive freshwater fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers and lakes in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity.},

  abstract = {Experimental sediment transport and river morphologic studies in laboratory flumes can use two sediment-supply methods: an imposed feed at the upstream end, or a recirculation of sediment from the downstream end to the upstream end. These methods generally produce similar equilibrium bed morphology, but temporal evolution can differ. The adjustment of natural rivers may be reproduced by both modes. Nevertheless, computer models of river morphodynamics typically use a sediment-feed boundary condition, which can impact the simulated evolution of transient features such as bedforms. The effect of sediment transport boundary conditions on bedform dynamics was analyzed through numerical experiments using a two-dimensional, depth-averaged sediment transport model. Two different boundary conditions were imposed at the inlet (constant sediment feed and sediment recirculated from the outlet) for two bedform scales (dunes and bars). The type of sediment transport boundary condition greatly influenced dune development. The sediment-recirculating condition produced a more dynamic bed morphology with dunes of higher amplitude. The associated zones of higher shear stress had a direct impact on the hydrodynamics and patterns of sediment transport. In the case of the bar bed morphology, the simulated bars had similar mean length and height for both sediment boundary conditions. However, the sediment-recirculating case produced a more dynamic bed, in which the dominant bar length varied over time. Finally, the simulated bed morphology with bars, agreed much better with that observed when using a calibrated sediment transport equation to match sediment discharges instead of the standard empirical sediment transport equations available in literature.},

  abstract = {Microhabitat suitability models are commonly used to estimate salmonid habitat abundance and quality with unknown accuracy or reliability. When tested, the metrics used to evaluate these models are often limited by the methods used to develop them. More generalized bioverification strategies that transcend methodology are therefore needed in ecohydraulics. This study further developed and applied such a generalized bioverification framework to four approximately 1-m-resolution rearing salmonid microhabitat suitability models. Water depth and velocity habitat suitability criteria (HSC) functions were developed for two size classes of rearing Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. mykiss using snorkel survey data collected over three years at seven sites along the lower Yuba River in California, USA. An expert-based cover HSC function was modified from previous studies. HSC functions were applied to previously validated, approximately 1-m-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamic models and cover maps of the river. Mann\textendash Whitney U tests confirmed that suitability values were significantly higher at utilized locations compared to randomly generated, non-utilized locations for all four models. Bootstrapped forage ratios demonstrated that microhabitat suitability models accurately predicted both preferred and avoided habitat beyond the 95\% confidence level. This generalized bioverification framework is recommended for evaluating and comparing the accuracy and reliability of ecohydraulic models used in habitat management worldwide.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a marked increase in the availability of morphodynamic models and a proliferation of new morphodynamic codes. As a consequence, morphodynamic models are increasingly developed, used and evaluated by non-experts, possibly leading to mistakes. This paper draws attention to five types of common mistakes. First, new morphodynamic codes are developed as extensions of existing hydrodynamic codes without including all essential physical processes. Second, model inputs are specified in a way that imposes morphodynamic patterns beforehand rather than letting them evolve freely. Third, detailed processes are parameterized inadequately for application to larger spatial and temporal scales. Fourth, physical and numerical phenomena are confused when interpreting model results. Fifth, the selection of modeling approaches is driven by the belief that complete data are a prerequisite for modeling and that the application of 2D and 3D models requires more data than the application of 1D models. Examples from fluvial morphodynamics are presented to illustrate these mistakes.},

  abstract = {Fishes are appropriate indicators of trends in aquatic biodiversity because their enormous variety reflects a wide range of environmental conditions. Fish also have a major impact on the distribution and abundance of other organisms in waters they inhabit. Examination of trends in freshwater fish faunas from different parts of the world indicate that most faunas are in serious decline and in need of immediate protection. Species most likely to be threatened with immediate extinction are either specialized for life in large rivers or are endemic species with very small distributions. We conservatively estimate that 20 percent of the freshwater fish species of the world (ca. 1800 species) are already extinct or in serious decline. Evidence for serious declines in marine fishes is limited largely to estuarine fishes, reflecting their dependence on freshwater inflows, or to fishes in inland seas. The proximate causes of fish species' decline can be divided into five broad categories: (1) competition for water, (2) habitat alteration, (3) pollution, (4) introduction of exotic species, and (5) commercial exploitation. Although one or two principal causes of decline can be identified for each species, the decline is typically the result of multiple, cumulative, long-term effects. Ways to protect aquatic biodiversity include the implementation of landscape-level management strategies, the creation of aquatic preserves, and the restoration of degraded aquatic habitats. Without rapid adoption of such measures we are likely to experience an accelerated rate of extinctions in aquatic environments as human populations continue to expand.},

  abstract = {Spawning substrate quality is a major factor influencing the early ontogeny of European nase (Chondrostoma nasus), a target species of conservation. Analogous to findings from salmonids, restoration of spawning grounds was hypothesized to enhance spawning, development and thus recruitment success of nase, by improving the substrate quality, and subsequently spawning site use, egg infiltration and protection of larvae in the interstitial zones before emergence. These assumptions were tested using a comparative approach by cleaning 50\% of the area of each spawning ground in two Bavarian rivers. Substrate cleaning resulted in an immediate reduction of 70\% fine sediment content with improvements still detectable 2 months later. Spawning nase used the restored areas of spawning grounds preferentially, which was evident in the number of spawning fish and the significantly higher number of eggs laid. Infiltration of eggs into the interstitial zone was distinctly more successful in the opened interstices of the cleaned spawning substrate, where they were found down to a depth of 20 cm. The same was true for larvae, which could be found down to 30 cm and up to 13 days after hatching. Moreover, higher peaks in the drift density of emerging larvae from the restored spawning substrate were detected (2.5 compared with 1.7 larvae m-3 discharge for the River Mangfall and 0.3 compared with 0.03 larvae m-3 for the River Sims). These results clearly indicate that gravel cleaning is a successful short-term restoration tool for nase spawning grounds. It is a quick, cheap and effective method for the conservation management of nase, which may also be applicable to other riverine species with a similiar ecology and incubation time, such as Barbus barbus, Squalius cephalus, Leuciscus leuciscus and Phoxinus phoxinus. This especially holds true if streams lack internal dynamics and suffer from high loads of fine sediment and colmation.},

  abstract = {Numerical modeling represents a state-of-the-art technique to simulate hydro-morphodynamic processes in river ecosystems. Numerical models are often validated based on observed topographic change in the form of pixel information on net erosion or deposition over a simulation period. When model validation is performed by a pixel-by-pixel comparison of exactly superimposed simulated and observed pixels, zero or negative correlation coefficients are often calculated, suggesting poor model performance. Thus, a pixel-by-pixel approach penalizes quantitative simulation errors, even if a model conceptually works well. To distinguish between reasonably well-performing and non-representative models, this study introduces and tests fuzzy map comparison methods. First, we use a fuzzy numerical map comparison to compensate for spatial offset errors in correlation analyses. Second, we add a level of fuzziness with a fuzzy kappa map comparison to additionally address quantitative inaccuracy in modeled topographic change by categorizing data. Sample datasets from a physical lab model and datasets from a 6.9 km long gravel\textendash cobble bed river reach enable the verification of the relevance of fuzzy map comparison methods. The results indicate that a fuzzy numerical map comparison is a viable technique to compensate for model errors stemming from spatial offset. In addition, fuzzy kappa map comparisons are suitable for objectively expressing subjectively perceived correlation between two maps, provided that a small number of categories is used. The methods tested and the resulting spatially explicit comparison maps represent a significant opportunity to improve the evaluation and potential calibration of numerical models of river ecosystems in the future.},

  abstract = {Water impoundment by dams strongly affects the river natural flow regime, its attributes and the related ecosystem biodiversity. Fostering the sustainability of water uses e.g., hydropower systems thus implies searching for innovative operational policies able to generate Dynamic Environmental Flows (DEF) that mimic natural flow variability. The objective of this study is to propose a Direct Policy Search (DPS) framework based on defining dynamic flow release rules to improve the global efficiency of storage systems. The water allocation policies proposed for dammed systems are an extension of previously developed flow redistribution rules for small hydropower plants by Razurel et\dbend al. (2016).The mathematical form of the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution applied to lake equations for the stored water in the dam is used to formulate non-proportional redistribution rules that partition the flow for energy production and environmental use. While energy production is computed from technical data, riverine ecological benefits associated with DEF are computed by integrating the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) for fishes with Richter's hydrological indicators. Then, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied to build ecological versus economic efficiency plot and locate its (Pareto) frontier. This study benchmarks two MOEAs (NSGA II and Borg MOEA) and compares their efficiency in terms of the quality of Pareto's frontier and computational cost. A detailed analysis of dam characteristics is performed to examine their impact on the global system efficiency and choice of the best redistribution rule. Finally, it is found that non-proportional flow releases can statistically improve the global efficiency, specifically the ecological one, of the hydropower system when compared to constant minimal flows.},

The technique was tested for three typical environments (water storage basin with silty water, laboratory flume with water containing seeding material of neutrally buoyant hollow glass spheres with a mean size around 8\textendash 10 {$\mu$}m, and outdoor flume with natural water containing air bubbles and organic particles). It was shown that the Doppler noise can change the measured turbulence characteristics significantly, even for high-level turbulence flows.},

  abstract = {Water is a naturally circulating resource that is constantly recharged. Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

The basic idea of how to estimate unit requirement of water resources to produce each commodity is introduced and values for major agricultural and stock products are presented. The concept of virtual water and the quantitative estimates can help in assessing a more realistic water scarcity index in each country, projecting future water demand for food supply, increasing public awareness on water, and identifying the processes wasting water in the production. Really required water in exporting countries is generally smaller than virtually required water in importing countries, reflecting the comparative advantage of water use efficiency, and it is estimated to be 680 km3/y for 2000. On the contrary the virtually required water for the same year is estimated to be 1,130 km3/y, and the difference of 450 km3/y is virtually saved by global trade. However, solely virtual water should not be used for any decision making since the idea of virtual water implies only the usage and influence of water and no concerns on social, cultural, and environmental implications. Virtual water trade also does not consider other limiting factors than water.},

Much ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the provision of ecosystem functions and services under current environmental conditions, yet this could lead to inappropriate management guidance and undervaluation of the importance of biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their `resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales. Although potentially less important in the short term, biodiversity, encompassing variation from within species to across landscapes, may be crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem functions and the services that they underpin.},

  abstract = {1. Stream ecosystems are increasingly impacted by multiple stressors that lead to a loss of sensitive species and an overall reduction in diversity. A dominant paradigm in ecological restoration is that increasing habitat heterogeneity (HH) promotes restoration of biodiversity. This paradigm is reflected in stream restoration projects through the common practice of re-configuring channels to add meanders and adding physical structures such as boulders and artificial riffles to restore biodiversity by enhancing structural heterogeneity. 2. To evaluate the validity of this paradigm, we completed an extensive evaluation of published studies that have quantitatively examined the reach-scale response of invertebrate species richness to restoration actions that increased channel complexity/HH. We also evaluated studies that used manipulative or correlative approaches to test for a relationship between physical heterogeneity and invertebrate diversity in streams that were not in need of restoration. 3. We found habitat and macroinvertebrate data for 78 independent stream or river restoration projects described by 18 different author groups in which invertebrate taxa richness data in response to the restoration treatment were available. Most projects were successful in enhancing physical HH; however, only two showed statistically significant increases in biodiversity rendering them more similar to reference reaches or sites. 4. Studies manipulating structural complexity in otherwise healthy streams were generally small in scale and less than half showed a significant positive relationship with invertebrate diversity. Only one-third of the studies that attempted to correlate biodiversity to existing levels of in-stream heterogeneity found a positive relationship. 5. Across all the studies we evaluated, there is no evidence that HH was the primary factor controlling stream invertebrate diversity, particularly in a restoration context. The findings indicate that physical heterogeneity should not be the driving force in selecting restoration approaches for most degraded waterways. Evidence suggests that much more must be done to restore streams impacted by multiple stressors than simply re-configuring channels and enhancing structural complexity with meanders, boulders, wood, or other structures. 6. Thematic implications: as integrators of all activities on the land, streams are sensitive to a host of stressors including impacts from urbanisation, agriculture, deforestation, invasive species, flow regulation, water extractions and mining. The impacts of these individually or in combination typically lead to a decrease in biodiversity because of reduced water quality, biologically unsuitable flow regimes, dispersal barriers, altered inputs of organic matter or sunlight, degraded habitat, etc. Despite the complexity of these stressors, a large number of stream restoration projects focus primarily on physical channel characteristics. We show that this is not a wise investment if ecological recovery is the goal. Managers should critically diagnose the stressors impacting an impaired stream and invest resources first in repairing those problems most likely to limit restoration.},

  abstract = {Rainfall is one the main drivers of soil erosion. The erosive force of rainfall is expressed as rainfall erosivity. Rainfall erosivity considers the rainfall amount and intensity, and is most commonly expressed as the R-factor in the USLE model and its revised version, RUSLE. At national and continental levels, the scarce availability of data obliges soil erosion modellers to estimate this factor based on rainfall data with only low temporal resolution (daily, monthly, annual averages). The purpose of this study is to assess rainfall erosivity in Europe in the form of the RUSLE R-factor, based on the best available datasets. Data have been collected from 1541 precipitation stations in all European Union (EU) Member States and Switzerland, with temporal resolutions of 5 to 60min. The R-factor values calculated from precipitation data of different temporal resolutions were normalised to R-factor values with temporal resolutions of 30min using linear regression functions. Precipitation time series ranged from a minimum of 5years to a maximum of 40years. The average time series per precipitation station is around 17.1years, the most datasets including the first decade of the 21st century. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has been used to interpolate the R-factor station values to a European rainfall erosivity map at 1km resolution. The covariates used for the R-factor interpolation were climatic data (total precipitation, seasonal precipitation, precipitation of driest/wettest months, average temperature), elevation and latitude/longitude. The mean R-factor for the EU plus Switzerland is 722MJmmha-1h-1yr-1, with the highest values ({$>$}1000MJmmha-1h-1yr-1) in the Mediterranean and alpine regions and the lowest ({$<$}500MJmmha-1h-1yr-1) in the Nordic countries. The erosivity density (erosivity normalised to annual precipitation amounts) was also the highest in Mediterranean regions which implies high risk for erosive events and floods.},

Yet, information necessary to derive exposure in terms of monetary value at the level of individual houses is often not available. This includes building type, size, quality, or age. In this study, we provide a universal method for estimating exposure of residential assets using only publicly available or open data. Using building footprints (polygons) from OpenStreetMap as a starting point, we utilized high-resolution elevation models of 30 European capitals and pan-European raster datasets to construct a Bayesian-network-based model that is able to predict building height. The model was then validated with a dataset of (1) buildings in Poland endangered by sea level rise, for which the number of floors is known, and (2) a sample of Dutch and German houses affected in the past by fluvial and pluvial floods, for which usable floor space area is known. Floor space of buildings is an important basis for approximating their economic value, including household contents. Here, we provide average national-level gross replacement costs of the stock of residential assets in 30 European countries, in nominal and real prices, covering the years 2000\textendash 2017. We either relied on existing estimates of the total stock of assets or made new calculations using the perpetual inventory method, which were then translated into exposure per square metre of floor space using data on countries' dwelling stocks. The study shows that the resulting standardized residential exposure values provide much better coverage and consistency compared to previous studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This mobilization is due to the action of fluid forces on the exposed grains. Substrate particles can participate in the bedload only to the extent that local or global scour results in their exposure on the surface. It follows that a calculation of the bedload transport rate of mixtures should be based on the availability of each size range in the surface layer. Herein an existing empirical substrate-based bedload relation for gravel mixtures, developed solely with reference to field data, is transformed into a surface-based relation.},

Individual particles obey Langevin equations which are switched on and off by particle entrainment and deposition. The flux is calculated as the rate of many such particles crossing a control surface within a specified observation time. Flux distributions inherit observation-time dependence from the on-off motions of particles. At the longest observation times, distributions converge to sharp peaks around classically-expected values, but at short times, fluctuations are erratic. We relate this scale dependence of bedload transport rates to the movement characteristics of individual grains. This work provides a statistical mechanics description for the fluctuations and observation-scale dependence of sediment transport rates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Large boulders can jam in constrictions, both in canyons) and man-made structures (e.g. slit-dams). Boulder jamming occurs stochastically, and partially governs the outflow rate of debris flow material. Explicit hydro-mechanical models of boulder-laden flows are too computationally demanding to study this stochasticity. This study presents a new framework implemented into a numerical program. This program encapsulates basic hydraulic equations and criteria predicting boulder blockage at narrow sections, along with a simple statistical way to compute boulder sizes and numbers. The program applies empirical estimates by experts of the average number of boulders in a deposit to evaluate how equivalent multi-phase flows would interact with a constriction. The model stochastically generate boulders that can obstruct the constriction(s). The program outputs simple descriptions of the upstream flow level over time, as well as the downstream outlet discharge rate and volume. The model is fast (5\textendash 30 s per run), allowing uncertainty propagation analyses of interactions between flows, boulders and constrictions. Interaction between both low- and high-risk flows can be quickly evaluated for different scenarios. For uncertainty propagation, we use possibility theory, which accommodates uncertainties relevant to debris flows. The framework gives practitioners a much-needed generalized approach for understanding the long-term behavior of boulder-laden flows through canyons, or for designing engineered structures. Finally, we apply the model to a field case \textendash{} the design of a proposed North American slit-dam \textendash{} thence elucidating the design requirements for effective flow control. We found that horizontal bars are necessary for dependably controlling outflow from this structure.},

  abstract = {Steep gravel-bed rivers sometimes experience floods that dramatically rework river bed structure and topography. Hazard assessments and paleo-event reconstructions require better knowledge of such phenomena. This paper explores morphodynamic evolution of steep channels carrying bedload-laden flows, using a generic Froude-scaled model. Bedload-laden floods were introduced in a narrow flume and spread into a 5 times wider unconfined area with a 0.1 steep slope (m/m). Image analysis enabled measurements taken at an unprecedented level of accuracy on unconfined flows laden with bedload. A flow reconstruction procedure was used to compute depth, Froude (Fr) and Shields ({$\tau$}*) numbers on millions of pixels based on a friction law and measurements of surface velocity, slope, and roughness. Despite the steep slope, Froude numbers proved to be mostly subcritical in all but the regions experiencing the most active sediment transport. Competent flows, identified by the transport stage higher than unity ( ), were near critical and seldom had Fr{$>$} 1.3\textendash 1.5. This demonstrates that, providing that bed width and structure can adjust, hydraulic features such as standing waves, hydraulic jumps, and lateral shock waves dissipate energy very efficiently in addition to adjusting channel features. These competent flows also tend to rework channels to approach the energy minimum of near-critical flows. This hypothesis was postulated by Gordon Grant (1997, https://doi.org/10.1029/96WR03134, Wat. Resour. Res. 33(2):349-358) but demonstrated here for the first time at this scale. Considering near-critical flows during discharges high enough to be clearly competent in laterally unconfined reaches seems reasonable as a first approximation in steep channels.},

  abstract = {The grain size distributions of bed load collected during flows that range from the threshold of motion to near bankfull in Nahal Eshtemoa, a coarse-grained ephemeral stream of southern Israel, give an unequivocal quantification of the change from unequal to near-equal mobility of grains of all available sizes. This second threshold occurs at {$\sim$}4.5 times the shear stress associated with initial motion (4.5\cyrchar\cyrt c). The level determined in Eshtemoa is much higher than previously defined by laboratory flume studies. The difference probably reflects the tighter packing and the greater interlock of natural streambeds and carries implications for a number of issues, including the modeling of sediment transport, especially in the context of dryland reservoir sedimentation. The proportion of time that flow exceeds 4.5\cyrchar\cyrt c determines the size distribution of cumulative bed load. Using a flow duration/sediment transport approach, in which fractional transport rates by grain size class are predicted with Parker's [1979] bed load function, it can be shown that the size distribution of bed load coarsens as the flow duration curve of individual flash floods incorporates progressively higher flows of variable duration. The method has utility because simple flood parameters such as peak discharge are imperfect predictors of sediment flux, particularly in desert streams where the shape of the flood hydrograph varies considerably from event to event. It is also shown that over a longer period (annual or decadal) the caliber of cumulative bed load depends upon the spectrum of flows in incident floods. The 4-year hydrograph record in Eshtemoa provides a model-derived bed load size distribution just finer than the unarmored bed material. The Eshtemoa data set can also be used to show clearly that water discharge in this type of ephemeral stream is ``effective'' or ``dominant'' over a wide range of flow stage ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 times bankfull and that bankfull discharge is no more significant than a wide range of other states of flow in transporting bed load.},

  abstract = {We examine some of the processes that determine the properties of marginal sea outflows by reviewing historical data and by an analysis of two simple models. Our numerical simulation model makes several of the streamtube approximations of Smith (1975), but goes on to include a Froude number-dependent entrainment parameterization, an Ekman number-dependent parameterization of broadening, and it can accept real bottom topography and real oceanic temperature and salinity profiles. This numerical model reproduces some of the main features of the four major outflows considered here (Mediterranean Sea, two from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, and Weddell Sea) including the bulk properties of the product water. A notable feature of these four outflows is that the density ordering of the source waters and product waters is reversed; for example, the densest source water comes from the Mediterranean Sea, the Mediterranean outflow makes the least dense product water. The reason is that intense entrainment of North Atlantic Central Water decreases the density of the Mediterranean outflow by about 1kg m-3 as it begins to descend the continental slope. The three high-latitude outflows are more or less similar in that strong entrainment generally occurs over short segments of the path where the bottom topography is relatively steep, typically just beyond the shelf-slope break. However, the densities of these outflows are decreased much less by entrainment (about 0.1kgm-3 in the Denmark Strait outflow, about 0.2kg m-3 in the Faroe Bank Channel outflow and 0.03kg m-3 in the Weddell Sea outflow) as they descend to the bottom in their respective basins. Entrainment causes much less decrease in density in these outflows primarily because of the lower density differences between these outflows and their overlying oceanic waters. High latitude outflows are more likely to reach the bottom because the oceanic water column in polar and subpolar seas is weakly stratified. These and other results indicate that the temperature and salinity of the oceanic water column are of considerable importance in determining the product water of a marginal sea outflow. Numerical experiments suggest that the density of the product water is remarkably insensitive to variations in the density of the source water. For example, if the density of the Mediterranean source water is arbitrarily increased by 1kg m-3, then the increased density difference between outflow and overlying oceanic water results in even more vigorous entrainment. This increases the transport of product water by about 106m3s-1 and limits the increase in density of the product water to only about 0.15kg m-3. These and other results are obtained also from a simple end-point model of a descending outflow.},

In contrast to other conventional MCDM techniques, SMCA has the ability to address uneven spatial distribution of criteria values in the evaluation and ranking of alternatives under various uncertainties. Using this technique, a new flood management tool has been developed within the framework of widely used GIS software ArcGIS. This tool has a user friendly interface which allows construction of user defined criteria, running of SCP computations under uncertain impacting factors and visualization of results. This tool has also the ability to interact with and use of classified Remote Sensing (RS) image layers, and other GIS feature layers like census block boundaries for flood damage calculation and loss of life estimation. The 100-year flood management strategy for Oconee River near the City of Milledgeville, Georgia, USA is chosen as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the software. The test result indicates that this new SMCA tool provides a very versatile environment for spatial comparison of various flood mitigation alternatives by taking into account various uncertainties, which will greatly enhance the quality of the decision making process. This tool can also be easily modified and implemented for solving a large variety of problems related to natural resources planning and management.},

  abstract = {Integrating a long-established soil erosion model with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, Borrelli et al. (1) set out to meet the needs of policymakers and earth-system modelers to better understand the future of soil erosion this century. Policymakers need this insight because of the constraints erosion places on achievement of multiple sustainable development goals including zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, no poverty, and life on land (2). The record of humankind does not induce confidence, evidencing our effect on soil distribution and quality and the consequences for past civilizations (3). The impact that soil erosion and deposition has on biogeochemical cycles (4{$\Downarrow$}\textendash 6) is leading to a recognition that earth-system models (ESMs) must look beyond vertical exchanges between soil and atmosphere and address carbon cycle perturbation cause by lateral transport of soil from land to ocean (7). The study by Borrelli et al. (1) is, therefore, timely. Research, dating back as far as the 1930s and the stimulus of the Dust Bowl, has provided valuable insights into the causes and consequences of soil erosion. However, global synthesis of erosion rates measured using a wide range of methodologies, has proven to be extremely challenging (8). By applying an empirical soil erosion model employing consistent and high spatial resolution global datasets, Borrelli et al. (1) address this challenge and offer simulations that can be coupled in a consistent manner to land use, soil conservation, and climate change scenarios. Comparing modeled soil erosion for 2015 and 2070, Borrelli et al. (1) identify potential for {$\sim$}10\% reduction in global rates under a sustainability-focused scenario (SSP1-RCP2.6), {$\sim$}10\% increase in global rates for a fossil-fuel intensive scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5), and relatively little change (+2\%) for an intermediate scenario (SSP2-RCP4.5). These results suggest cobenefits for erosion reduction in attempts to pursue a path \ldots{}  [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1To whom correspondence may be addressed. Email: t.a.quine\{at\}exeter.ac.uk.

  abstract = {This article presents an experimental study of the hydraulic transport of very large solid particles (above 5mm) in an horizontal pipe. Two specific masses are used for the solids. The solids are spheres that are large with respect to the diameter of the pipe (5\%, 10\% and 15\%) or real stones of arbitrary shapes but constant specific mass and a size distribution similar to the tested spherical beads. Finally, mixtures of size and/or specific mass are studied. The regimes are characterized with differential pressure measurements and visualizations. The results are compared to empirical models based on dimensionless numbers, together with 1D models that are based on mass and momentum balance. A model for the transport of large particles in vertical pipes is also proposed and tested on data available in the Literature, in order to compare the trends that are observed in the present experiments in a horizontal pipe to the trends predicted for a vertical pipe. The results show that the grain size and specific mass have a strong effect on the transition point between regimes with a stationary bed and dispersed flows. The pressure drops are moreover smaller for large particles in the horizontal part contrary to what occurs for vertical pipes, and to the predictions of the empirical correlations.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTIndirect bedload transport measurements have been made with the Swiss plate geophone system in five gravel-bed mountain streams. These geophone sensors record the motion of bedload particles transported over a steel plate mounted flush with the channel bed. To calibrate the geophone system, direct bedload transport measurements were undertaken simultaneously. At the Erlenbach in Switzerland, a moving-basket sampler was used. At the Fischbach and Ruetz streams in Austria, a Helley\textendash Smith type bedload sampler provided the calibration measurements. A Bunte-type bedload trap was used at the Rofenache stream in Austria. At the Nahal Eshtemoa in Israel, Reid-type slot bedload samplers were used. To characterize the response of the geophone signal to bedload particles impacting on the plate, geophone summary values were calculated from the raw signal and stored at one second intervals. The number of impulses, i.e. the number of peaks above a pre-defined threshold value of the geophone output signal, correlated well with field measured gravel transport loads and was found to be a robust parameter. The relations of impulses to gravel transport loads were generally near-linear, but the steepness of the calibration relations differed from site to site. By comparing the calibration measurements from the different field sites and utilizing insights gained during preliminary flume experiments, it has been possible to identify the main factors that are responsible for site specific differences in the calibration coefficient. The analysis of these calibration measurements indicates that the geophone signal also contains some information about the grain size distribution of bedload.

Using an impact plate geophone system, continuous bed load transport measurements were made during 6 years in two mountain streams in Austria. The two streams have a snow-melt and glacier-melt dominated hydrologic regime resulting in frequent transport activity during the summer half year. Periods of days to weeks were identified which are associated with approximately constant Shields values that indicate quasi-stable bed conditions. Between these stable periods, the position of the bed load transport function varied while its steepness remained approximately constant. For integration time scales of several hours to 1 day, the fluctuations in bed load transport decreased and the correlation between bed load transport and water discharge increased. For integration times of about 70\textendash 100 days, bed load transport is determined by discharge or shear stress to within a factor of about 2, relative to the 6 year mean level. Bed load texture increased with increasing mean flow strength and mean transport intensity. Weak and predominantly clockwise daily hysteresis of bed load transport was found for the first half of the summer period.},

High-quality bed-load transport data sets are identified and analyzed, showing that the bed-load transport in the sand range is related to velocity to power 2.5. The bed-load transport is not much affected by particle size. The prediction of bed roughness is addressed and the prediction of bed-load transport in steady river flow is extended to coastal flow applying an intrawave approach. Simplified bed-load transport formulas are presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of bed-load transport in river and coastal flows. It is shown that the sediment transport of fine silts to coarse sand can be described in a unified model framework using fairly simple expressions. The proposed model is fully predictive in the sense that only the basic hydrodynamic parameters (depth, current velocity, wave height, wave period, etc.) and the basic sediment characteristics (d10d10{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}10{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}, d50d50{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}50{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}, d90d90{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}90{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}, water temperature, and salinity) need to be known. The prediction of the effective bed roughness is an integral part of the model.},

Even critical, fundamental operations such as cross-calibrations of related sensors operating on different platforms or orbits, e.g. spacecraft and aircraft, are integrative analyses. The great variety of Earth Science data types and the spatiotemporal irregularity of important low-level (ungridded) data has so far made their integration a customized, tedious process which scales in neither variety nor volume. Generic, higher-level (gridded) data products are easier to use, at the cost of being farther from the original observations and having to settle with grids, interpolation assumptions, and uncertainties that limit their applicability. The root cause of the difficulty in scalably bringing together diverse data is the current rectilinear geo-partitioning of Earth Science data into conventional arrays indexed using consecutive integer indices and then packaged into files. Such indices suffice for archival, search, and retrieval, but lack a common geospatial semantics, which is mitigated by adding on floating-point encoded longitude-latitude information for registration. An alternative to floating-point, the SpatioTemporal Adaptive Resolution Encoding (STARE) provides an~integer encoding for geo-spatiotemporal location and neighborhood that transcends the use of files and native array indexing, allowing diverse data to be organized on scalable, distributed computing and storage platforms.},

It is argued that in existing schemes much of this information is degraded, and that only certain features of the exact solution are worth striving for. It is shown that these features can be obtained by constructing a matrix with a certain ``Property U.'' Matrices having this property are exhibited for the equations of steady and unsteady gasdynamics. In order to construct thems it is found helpful to introduce ``parameter vectors'' which notably simplify the structure of the conservation laws.}

  abstract = {An important source of uncertainty affecting the results of 3-D hydrodynamic models of wind-driven lakes, and one which is rarely formally addressed, arises in the development of spatially and temporally varying wind fields used as surface boundary conditions. We analyze one of the sources of uncertainty in this process and propose a simple and straightforward method to assess the uncertainty in model results arising from the construction of wind fields for surface boundary conditions. Taking into account such uncertainty in model results, it is demonstrated that a 3-D hydrodynamic model is able to represent mathematically the evolution of the stratification in a large wind-driven lake. Using the Salton Sea as a case study, and taking model uncertainty into consideration, we demonstrate that a reduction of the lake size, as has been proposed for restoration of the Salton Sea, will induce a stronger and more persistent stratification. These changes in stratification are shown to be statistically significant. As the number of weather stations used to reconstruct the wind field over water increases from three to five, agreement between field and simulated data improves, possibly because of reduced uncertainty in the spatial interpolation of wind data. Differences in stratification between the Salton Sea as it currently exists and as it could exist if restoration plans are implemented, with the lake occupying the northern end of the basin and its surface area reduced by 80\%, are the result of the spatial variability of the wind and changes in the magnitude of the wind-driven mechanical energy fluxes into the lake.},

Whereas the effects of flow regulation on hydrology, sediment transport and biodiversity have long been examined, responses at the food-web level remain understudied. Environmental variation is a key control of food-web structure. Thus, we predicted that flow regulation would impact food-chain length (FCL) via changes in the flow variation regime, and we tested this prediction in a set of flow unregulated to completely regulated reaches in a Mediterranean river basin. In each reach, we characterised flow variation, together with two other putative controls of FCL (productivity and habitat size). We combined community data with carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to estimate food-chain length, and Bayesian mixing models allowed estimates of dietary proportions of consumers. Flow variation was paramount in controlling FCL in the studied river network, and this same control largely explained the degree of omnivory among top predators. Thus, omnivory mechanisms were the main proximate structural mechanism allowing shifts in food-web structure and linking disturbance regimes to FCL. Our results suggest that flow regulation in Mediterranean rivers may impact food-web structure even when no significant changes in community composition are observed. If highly variable Mediterranean streams become increasingly affected by flow regulation, the resulting more stable conditions could enhance intraguild predation and thus lengthen riverine food chains.},

  abstract = {Large wood promotes fundamental changes in river hydraulics and morphology, playing a relevant role in river ecology but also in flood hazard. Accurate predictions of large wood dynamics in terms of deposition patterns and travel distance are still lacking and only recently have numerical models been developed to this end. In this work we enhance the capabilities of the numerical model Iber-Wood in reproducing large wood dynamics in shallow braided rivers and validate it by comparing simulations with the results of previous laboratory experiments. The flume experiments provide high-resolution observations of wood travel distances and depositional patterns of wood. The comparison proves useful to improve the numerical simulation of i) the interactions between wood pieces and the river bed (e.g., when wood pieces are transported by dragging); ii) wood pieces with roots, and iii) the formation of wood jams (i.e., accumulations of {$>$} 3 wood pieces). A sensitivity analysis reveals the crucial role of bed topography, with limited effect played by drag and restitution coefficients. Taking advantage of a controlled environment with similar simplifying hypotheses, we combine the strengths of both physical and numerical modeling to explore the parameters that are most effective in controlling wood dynamics. We use the numerical model to explore the effect of unsteady flow conditions, with different wood supply input. The resulting wood depositional patterns, jam formation and travel distances during floods may improve our understanding of some of the controls on bio-geomorphic evolutionary trajectories of braided rivers.},

  abstract = {Since the early 1990s, US Forest Service researchers have made thousands of bedload measurements in steep, coarse-grained channels in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. In this paper we use data from 19 of those sites to characterize patterns and rates of coarse sediment transport for a range of channel types and sizes, including step\textendash pool, plane-bed, pool\textendash riffle, and near-braided channels. This effort builds upon previous work where we applied a piecewise regression model to (1) relate flow to rates of bedload transport and (2) define phases of transport in coarse-grained channels. Earlier, the model was tested using bedload data from eight sites on the Fraser Experimental Forest near Fraser, Colorado. The analysis showed good application to those data and to data from four supplementary channels to which the procedure was applied. The earlier results were, however, derived from data collected at sites that, for the most part, have quite similar geology and runoff regimes. In this paper we evaluate further the application of piecewise regression to data from channels with a wider range of geomorphic conditions. The results corroborate with those from the earlier work in that there is a relatively narrow range of discharges at which a substantial change in the nature of bedload transport occurs. The transition from primarily low rates of sand transport (phase I) to higher rates of sand and coarse gravel transport (phase II) occurs, on average, at about 80 per cent of the bankfull (1{$\cdot$}5-year return interval) discharge. A comparison of grain sizes moved during the two phases showed that coarse gravel is rarely trapped in the samplers during phase I transport. Moreover, the movement and capture of the D16 to D25 grain size of the bed surface seems to correspond with the onset of phase II transport, particularly in systems with largely static channel surfaces. However, while there were many similarities in observed patterns of bedload transport at the 19 studied sites, each had its own `bedload signal' in that the rate and size of materials transported largely reflected the nature of flow and sediment particular to that system.

  abstract = {Differences in the transport rate and size of bedload exist for varying levels of flow in coarse-grained channels. For gravel-bed rivers, at least two phases of bedload transport, with notably differing qualities, have been described in the literature. Phase I consists primarily of sand and small gravel moving at relatively low rates over a stable channel surface. Transport rates during Phase II are considerably greater than Phase I and more coarse grains are moved, including material from both the channel surface and subsurface. Transition from Phase I to Phase II indicates initiation and transport of grains comprising the coarse surface layer common in steep mountain channels. While the existence of different phases of transport is generally acknowledged, the threshold between them is often poorly defined. We present the results of the application of a piecewise regression analysis to data on bedload transport collected at 12 gravel-bed channels in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. The piecewise regression recognizes the existence of different linear relationships over different ranges of discharge. The inflection, where the fitted functions intersect, is interpreted as the point of transition from Phase I to Phase II transport; this is termed breakpoint. A comparison of grain sizes moved during the two phases shows that coarse gravel is rarely trapped in the samplers during Phase I transport, indicating negligible movement of grains in this size range. Gravel larger than about D16 of the channel surface is more consistently trapped during Phase II transport. The persistence of coarse gravel in bedload samples provides good evidence that conditions suitable for coarse grain transport have been reached, even though the size of the sediment approaches the size limits of the sampler (76 mm in all cases). A relative breakpoint (Rbr) was defined by the ratio between the discharge at the breakpoint and the 1{$\cdot$}5-year flow (a surrogate for bankfull discharge) expressed as a percentage. The median value of Rbr was about 80 percent, suggesting that Phase II begins at about 80 percent of the bankfull discharge, though the observed values of Rbr ranged from about 60 to 100 percent. Variation in this value appears to be independent of drainage area, median grain size, sorting of bed materials, and channel gradient, at least for the range of parameters measured in 12 gravel-bed channels.

Intensive abstraction and regulation cause river ecosystems to shift towards non-natural flow regimes, which might have implications for their water quality, biological structure and functioning. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the potential effects of water stress on nutrients, microcontaminants, biological communities (bacteria, algae, invertebrates and fish), and ecosystem functions (organic matter breakdown, gross primary production and respiration). Despite the different nature of the flow regime changes, our meta-analysis showed significant effects of human-driven water stress, such as significant increases in algal biomass and metabolism and reduced invertebrate richness, abundance and density and organic matter decomposition. Water stress also significantly decreased phosphate concentration and increased the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds. The magnitude of significant effects was dependent on climate, rainfall regime, period of the year, river size and type of water stress. Among the different causes of water stress, flow regulation by dams produced the strongest effects, followed by water abstraction and channelization.},

  abstract = {Many power plants require large quantities of water for cooling purposes. The water taken from the source water body (e.g., lakes, estuaries, bays and rivers) circulates through the plant and returns to the source through outfall with a higher temperature. For optimal performance of the power plant, the intake inlet and discharge outlet should be meticulously placed so that the heated water will not recirculate back into the power plant. In this study, the Flow module of the Delft3D software is employed to simulate the temperature transport within the study area in three-dimensional and nested format. Model results are used to optimize the location of intake inlets, outfall outlets and diffuser port orientations. The physical processes used in the study are tidal fluctuations, winds, river discharges, salinity and temperature. The subject power plant (power plant parameters presented in this paper are realistic; however, they do not target any specific power plant within the study area) has a nominal capacity of 2600 MW and is planned to be located in Delaware Bay, USA. Existing field measurements are used to calibrate the model in a coupled two-staged fashion for main tidal constituents, currents and water temperature. The sensitivity of the model against various input parameters is tested, and conservative values are selected. The location of the intake is fixed, and the location of the outfall is changed until the thermal impact to the intake is less than 1 \textdegree C. Analysis of the results shows that there is a linear logarithmic relation between the excess temperatures at the intake inlet and horizontal eddy diffusivity. The     k - {$\epsilon$}     turbulence closure results in higher excess temperature and a more conservative design. Extending the outfall location to the deeper portion of the estuary combined with port orientations reduces the impact by keeping the thermal plume away from the intake inlet and meeting the established criteria. It is concluded that an approximate distance of 1300 m is the optimal location for the power plant outfall outlets. In addition, the diffuser ports should not discharge the heated water toward the intake and have to be oriented away from the line connecting outfall to the intake.},

Physical model tests were used to explore how the wood position and submergence level (discharge) affect wake structure, and hence the resulting habitat. We observed a von-K\'arm\'an vortex street (VS) for emergent logs placed at the channel center, while no VS formed for submerged logs, because the flow entering the wake from above the log (sweeping flow) inhibited VS formation. As a result, emergent logs placed at the channel center resulted in ten times higher turbulent kinetic energy compared to submerged logs. In addition, both spatial variation in time-mean velocity and turbulence level increased with increasing log length and decreasing submergence level. Submerged logs and logs placed at the channel side created a greater velocity deficit and a longer recirculation zone, both of which can increase the residence time in the wake and deposition of organic matter and nutrients. The results demonstrate that variation in log size and degree of submergence can be used as a tool to vary habitat suitability for different fish preferences. To maximize habitat diversity in rivers, we suggest a diverse large wood placement.},

  abstract = {Boussinesq's hypothesis is at the heart of eddy viscosity models, which are used in many different fields to model turbulent flows. In its present time formulation, this hypothesis corresponds to an alignment between the Reynolds stress and mean strain tensors. We begin with historical remarks on Boussinesq's results and recall that he introduced a local averaging twenty years before Reynolds, but using an approach that prevented him from discovering Reynolds' stress tensor. We then introduce an indicator that characterizes the validity of this hypothesis. For experimental and numerical databases, when the tensors are known, this can be used to directly estimate the validity of this hypothesis. We show, using several different databases, that this hypothesis is almost never verified. We address, in conclusion, the analogy with kinetic theory, and the reason why this analogy cannot be applied, in general, for turbulent flows. To cite this article: F.G. Schmitt, C. R. Mecanique 335 (2007). R\'esum\'e L'hypoth\`ese de Boussinesq est au coeur des mod\`eles de viscosit\'e, utilis\'es dans un grand nombre de contextes pour mod\'eliser des \'ecoulements turbulents. Dans sa formulation moderne, cette hypoth\`ese correspond \`a un alignement entre tenseur de contrainte de Reynolds et tenseur de d\'eformation moyen. Nous rappelons le contexte historique de l'\'enonc\'e de cette hypoth\`ese, en soulignant que Boussinesq avait introduit une moyenne locale vingt ans avant Reynolds, mais en effectuant une erreur qui l'a priv\'e de la mise en \'evidence du tenseur de Reynolds. Nous introduisons ensuite un indicateur, compris entre 0 et 1, indiquant le degr\'e de validit\'e de cette hypoth\`ese. Pour des bases de donn\'ees exp\'erimentales et num\'eriques, lorsque les diff\'erents tenseurs sont connus, ceci permet de tester directement, a priori, cette hypoth\`ese. Nous montrons ainsi, utilisant diff\'erentes bases de donn\'ees d'\'ecoulements turbulents, que l'hypoth\`ese n'est presque jamais v\'erifi\'ee. Nous discutons en conclusion de la th\'eorie cin\'etique des gaz et de la raison pour laquelle cette analogie est discutable pour les \'ecoulements turbulents. Pour citer cet article : F.G.

  abstract = {In steep mountain streams, macro-roughness elements typically increase both flow energy dissipation and the threshold of motion compared to lower-gradient channels, reducing the part of the flow energy available for bed load transport. Bed load transport models typically take account of these effects either by reducing the acting bed shear stress or by increasing the critical parameters for particle entrainment. Here we evaluate bed load transport models for mixed-size sediments and models based on a median grain size using a large field data set of fractional bed load transport rates. We derive reference shear stresses and bed load transport relations based on both the total boundary shear stress and a reduced (or ``effective'') shear stress that accounts for flow resistance due to macro-roughness. When reference shear stresses are derived from the total boundary shear stress, they are closely related to channel slope, but when they are derived from the effective shear stress, they are almost invariant with channel slope. The performance of bed load transport models is generally comparable when using the total shear stress and a channel slope-related reference shear stress, or when using the effective shear stress and a constant reference shear stress. However, dimensionless bed load transport relations are significantly steeper for the total stress approach, whereas they are similar to the commonly used fractional Wilcock and Crowe (WC) transport model for the effective stress approach. This similarity in the relations allows the WC model, developed for lower-gradient streams, to be used in combination with an effective shear stress approach, in steep mountain streams.},

  abstract = {Sustainable concepts of ecologically functional rivers challenge engineers, researchers, and planners. Advanced numerical modeling techniques produce nowadays high-precision terrain maps and spatially explicit hydrodynamic data that aid river design. Because of their complexity, however, ecomorphological processes can only be reproduced to a limited extent in numerical models. Intelligent post-processing of hydrodynamic numerical model results still enables ecological river engineering measures to be designed sustainably. We have embedded state-of-the-art concepts in novel algorithms to effectively plan self-maintaining habitat-enhancing design features, such as vegetation plantings or the artificial introduction of streamwood, with high physical stability. The algorithms apply a previously developed lifespan mapping technique and habitat suitability analysis to terraforming and bioengineering river design features. The results not only include analytical synopses, but also provide actively created, automatically generated project plans, which are optimized as a function of an efficiency metric that describes "costs per m{$^2$} net gain in seasonal habitat area for target species". To make the benefits of these novel algorithms available to a wide audience, we have implemented the codes in an open-source program called River Architect. In this contribution, we present the novel design concepts and algorithms as well as a case study of their application to a river restoration project on the Yuba River in California (USA). With River Architect, we ultimately created an objective, parameter-based, and automated framework for the design of vegetative river engineering features. In addition, we are able to define a framework for stable and ecologically viable terraforming features, but part of the planning of earthworks is still left to expert assessment. Thus, improving the algorithms to plan terraforming of permanent, self-sustaining, and eco-morphodynamic riverbed structures based on site-specific parameters is one of the future challenges.},

  abstract = {Interactions between fluvial processes and floodplain ecosystems occur upon a floodplain surface that is often physically complex. Spatial patterns in floodplain topography have only recently been quantified over multiple scales, and discrepancies exist in how floodplain surfaces are perceived to be spatially organised. We measured spatial patterns in floodplain topography for pool 9 of the Upper Mississippi River, USA, using moving window analyses of eight surface metrics applied to a 1\dbend 1m2 DEM over multiple scales. The metrics used were Range, SD, Skewness, Kurtosis, CV, SDCURV, Rugosity, and Vol:Area, and window sizes ranged from 10 to 1000m in radius. Surface metric values were highly variable across the floodplain and revealed a high degree of spatial organisation in floodplain topography. Moran's I correlograms fit to the landscape of each metric at each window size revealed that patchiness existed at nearly all window sizes, but the strength and scale of patchiness changed within window size, suggesting that multiple scales of patchiness and patch structure exist in the topography of this floodplain. Scale thresholds in the spatial patterns were observed, particularly between the 50 and 100m window sizes for all surface metrics and between the 500 and 750m window sizes for most metrics. These threshold scales are 15\dbend 20\% and 150\% of the main channel width (1\dbend 2\% and 10\dbend 15\% of the floodplain width), respectively. These thresholds may be related to structuring processes operating across distinct scale ranges. By coupling surface metrics, multi-scale analyses, and correlograms, quantifying floodplain topographic complexity is possible in ways that should assist in clarifying how floodplain ecosystems are structured.},

Although mathematical predictors can be used for estimation, they do not adequately represent porosities. The objective of this study was to assess a new approach for the determination of porosity of frozen sediment samples. The method is based on volume determination by applying Structure-from-Motion with Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) to estimate a 3D volumetric model based on overlapping imagery. The method was applied on artificial sediment mixtures as well as field samples. In addition, the commonly used water replacement method was applied to determine porosities in comparison with the SfM-MVS method. We examined a range of porosities from 0.16 to 0.46 that are representative of the wide range of porosities found in rivers. SfM-MVS performed well in determining volumes of the sediment samples. A very good correlation (r\,=\,0.998, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) was observed between the SfM-MVS and the water replacement method. Results further show that the water replacement method underestimated total sample volumes. A comparison with several mathematical predictors showed that for non-uniform samples the calculated porosity based on the standard deviation performed better than porosities based on the median grain size. None of the predictors were effective at estimating the porosity of the field samples.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have revealed the close coupling of components of annual streamflow hydrographs and the germination and establishment ofPopulus species. Key hydrograph components include the timing and magnitude of flood peaks, the rate of decline of the recession limb, and the magnitude of base flows. In this paper, we retrospectively examine establishment of four woody riparian species along the Bill Williams River, Arizona, USA, in the context of annual patterns of streamflow for the years 1993\textendash 1995. The four species examined were the nativePopulus fremontii, Salix gooddingii, andBaccharis salicifolia and the exoticTamarix ramosissima. We modeled locations suitable for germination of each species along eight study transects by combining historic discharge data, calculated stage-discharge relationships, and seed-dispersal timing observations. This germination model was, a highly significant predictor of seedling establishment. Where germination was predicted to occur, we compared values of several environmental variables in quadrats where we observed successful establishment with quadrats where establishment was unsuccessful. The basal area of mature woody vegetation, the maximum annual, depth to ground water, and the maximum rate of water-table decline were the variables that best discriminated between quadrats with and without seedlings. The results of this study suggest that the basic components of models that relate establishment ofPopulus spp. to annual patterns of streamflow may also be applicable to other woody riparian species. Reach-to-reach variation in stage-discharge relationships can influence model parameters, however, and should be considered if results such as ours are to be used in efforts to prescribe reservoir releases to promote establishment of native riparian vegetation.},

  abstract = {Sediment transport in meanders is a complex phenomenon due to its three-dimensional behavior (i.e., the presence of secondary currents). As a result, in river bends, sediments are eroded from the outer bank, resulting in depositions at the inner bank. In order to describe the complexity of flow characteristics and sediment transport mechanisms in river bends, the use of three-dimensional numerical models is essential. Nevertheless, these models are highly parameterized; therefore, the model calibration process becomes demanding. Using optimization methods for model calibration can diminish the manual effort and avoid users' subjectivity. Besides, it helps to decrease errors caused by wrong assumptions and unrealistic combinations of involving parameters. In this study, the 3D numerical model SSIIM 2 is used to simulate the flow field as well as morphological bed changes in a U-shaped bend. The automatic calibration tool PEST is used to calibrate the morphodynamic model by altering different input parameters. The result of this study reveals that using automatic calibration can noticeably reduce the calibration time and the user-intervention in the calibration process. Comparisons between the simulated bed topography changes and the experimental data regarding the deposition and scour regions, as well as their magnitudes, demonstrate a high degree of accuracy for the automatic calibration process.},

  abstract = {In curved channels, the flow characteristics, sediment transport mechanisms, and bed evolution are more complex than in straight channels, owing to the interaction between the centrifugal force and the pressure gradient, which results in the formation of secondary currents. Therefore, using an appropriate numerical model that considers this fully three-dimensional effect, and subsequently, the model calibration are substantial tasks for achieving reliable simulation results. The calibration of numerical models as a subjective approach can become challenging and highly time-consuming, especially for inexperienced modelers, due to dealing with a large number of input parameters with respect to hydraulics and sediment transport. Using optimization methods can notably facilitate and expedite the calibration procedure by reducing the user intervention, which results in a more objective selection of parameters. This study focuses on the application of four different optimization algorithms for calibration of a 3D morphodynamic numerical model of a curved channel. The performance of a local gradient-based method is compared with three global optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational time (model runs). The outputs of the optimization methods demonstrate similar sets of calibrated parameters and almost the same degree of accuracy according to the achieved minimum of the objective function. Accordingly, the most efficient method concerning the number of model runs (i.e., local optimization method) is selected for further investigation by setting up additional numerical models using different sediment transport formulae and various discharge rates. The comparisons of bed topography changes in several longitudinal and cross-sections between the measured data and the results of the calibrated numerical models are presented. The outcomes show an acceptable degree of accuracy for the automatically calibrated models.},

  abstract = {The formulation of a fully compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheric model called the Model for Prediction Across Scales\textendash Atmosphere (MPAS-A) is described. The solver is discretized using centroidal Voronoi meshes and a C-grid staggering of the prognostic variables, and it incorporates a split-explicit time-integration technique used in many existing nonhydrostatic meso- and cloud-scale models. MPAS can be applied to the globe, over limited areas of the globe, and on Cartesian planes. The Voronoi meshes are unstructured grids that permit variable horizontal resolution. These meshes allow for applications beyond uniform-resolution NWP and climate prediction, in particular allowing embedded high-resolution regions to be used for regional NWP and regional climate applications. The rationales for aspects of this formulation are discussed, and results from tests for nonhydrostatic flows on Cartesian planes and for large-scale flow on the sphere are presented. The results indicate that the solver is as accurate as existing nonhydrostatic solvers for nonhydrostatic-scale flows, and has accuracy comparable to existing global models using icosahedral (hexagonal) meshes for large-scale flows in idealized tests. Preliminary full-physics forecast results indicate that the solver formulation is robust and that the variable-resolution-mesh solutions are well resolved and exhibit no obvious problems in the mesh-transition zones.},

  abstract = {Dams store water and trap sediment in their reservoirs. Downstream river segments, hence, are affected by a limited sediment dynamics. This becomes obvious by river bed incision, limited geomorphological variability and depletion of hydraulic habitats for in-stream ecological organisms. Replenishment is a measure to counteract the lack of sediment. In segments dams such a sediment replenishment can be combined with the release of an artificial flood, by activating spillways and bottom outlets. Recent laboratory studies revealed the potential of multi-deposit replenishment configuration towards an increase of geomorphological richness in the river. However, this has not yet been tested in the field. The hydro-morphological index of diversity (HMID), is based on the spatial variability flow depth and velocity in a river segment, allowing the quantification of the change in morphology such a measure. Its ease in computation and its objectivity makes the index a useful tool for a large variety of users. However, knowledge concerning data sufficiency and a standardized sampling procedure does not exist. Further, the HMID does not account for temporal variability. This research aims at closing these gaps of knowledge for a sustainable management of complex floodplains downstream of dams. Flow depth and velocity data from 19 river segments were analyzed with the HMID. Structured sub-sampling and analysis of the data revealed different data sufficiency depending on the complexity of the river geomorphology. A representative HMID value is computed from at least 100 datapoints distributed over eight cross-sections, in braided rivers more datapoints are required. The geomorphological changes by an artificial flood event in the Sarine were analyzed with the HMID. In the impact perimeter of the multi-deposit sediment replenishment, the HMID increased by 36 \% in the Sarine, in the rest of the river 18 \%. A similar study was investigated at the Sp\"ol, pointing out that sediment availability is crucial for the hydraulic habitat diversity. With the help of 489 tracer stones, the movement of the replenished sediment was investigated in detail. The deposition pattern results in repeating sediment clusters on the riverbed, as it was observed in the laboratory experiments. For the two characteristic diameters, the tracers allowed the estimation of transport velocities of 19 cm/min (dm = 57 mm) and 28 cm/min (d90 = 113 mm) during the flood event and consequently the erosion efficiency of the different parts of the flood hydrograph. Macroinvertebrates were less affected by the artificial flood event in the hydropeaking river segment of the Sarine compared with the residual flow segment. The species diversity indices decreased significantly due to the artificial flood event. A direct link between flow regime and EPT richness was observed. A river with a natural flow regime hosts the highest richness of macroinvertebrates followed the residual and finally the hydropeaking flow regime. For other ecological indicators, additional physical river parameters for example the frequency duration curve or the grain size distribution need to be considered as well.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we verified a 3D computational fluid dynamics model for vertical slot fish-passes (VSFs) that employs the renormalization-group k-epsilon turbulence model (RNG KE) and the volume of fluid (VOF) method. We compared model calculations with experiments in two pool designs T1 and T2 of an experimental VSF and with 2D calculations using the shallow water equations (SWE) and the standard k-epsilon (2D SKE) model. Calculations of the 3D model showed (1) good agreement with experiments and 2D calculations in predicting mean flow velocities, (2) better performance in the determination of the water surface in the VSF, which is attributed to the accurate VOF method, (3) superior prediction of turbulence characteristics than the 2D model, which is due to the 3D RNG KE model that overcomes the problem of turbulence overestimation of the 2D SKE model, and to the fact that the 3D model takes into account the 3D features of the flow in the fish pass. Moreover, the present 3D calculations showed that the common assumptions in VSFs that (1) the flow is 2D, and (2) the simulation of 4 pools of a VSF is sufficient to obtain satisfactory results, are not always valid. Flow can be considered as 2D only in pool design T2 and for certain geometries and flow characteristics in pool design T1; while, eventually, all the pools of a fish pass need to be modeled to ensure accurate results. Finally, the present work illustrates the need to perform fish experiments simultaneously with flow experiments.},

  abstract = {We present an accurate numerical approximation to the Saint-Venant-Hirano model for mixed-sediment morphodynamics in one space dimension. Our solution procedure originates from the fully-unsteady matrix-vector formulation developed in [54]. The principal part of the problem is solved by an explicit Finite Volume upwind method of the path-conservative type, by which all the variables are updated simultaneously in a coupled fashion. The solution to the principal part is embedded into a splitting procedure for the treatment of frictional source terms. The numerical scheme is extended to second-order accuracy and includes a bookkeeping procedure for handling the evolution of size stratification in the substrate. We develop a concept of balancedness for the vertical mass flux between the substrate and active layer under bed degradation, which prevents the occurrence of non-physical oscillations in the grainsize distribution of the substrate. We suitably modify the numerical scheme to respect this principle. We finally verify the accuracy in our solution to the equations, and its ability to reproduce one-dimensional morphodynamics due to streamwise and vertical sorting, using three test cases. In detail, (i) we empirically assess the balancedness of vertical mass fluxes under degradation; (ii) we study the convergence to the analytical linearised solution for the propagation of infinitesimal-amplitude waves [54], which is here employed for the first time to assess a mixed-sediment model; (iii) we reproduce Ribberink\dbend s E8-E9 flume experiment [46].},

  abstract = {Root depth influences plant distribution and function but has been little studied in dryland riparian zones. Using values from literature and excavations, this study examined rooting patterns for 125 riparian species of southwestern USA and asked if maximum root depth varies with 1) moisture affinity, 2) growth habit, 3) flowering season, and 4) exotic vs. native status. Root depth varied with all factors analyzed. Hydroriparian species had shallower roots than mesoriparian and xeroriparian species. Annuals had shallower roots than perennials, and shrubs had deeper roots than trees. Hydroriparian perennials and cool-season annuals had the shallowest roots; xeroriparian shrubs had the deepest. Plants varied widely in root depth as well as in root length (near surface laterals) and root:shoot ratios. This wide range is typical of ecosystems that have many water sources, with each rooting pattern being adaptive in a different hydrogeomorphic setting. Exotic species showed trait divergence as evidenced by greater rooting depths. There were many data gaps, with several species having no rooting data. There is a need for site-based studies of rooting patterns in dryland riparian zones to more accurately document hydrogeomorphic niches and predict changes in plant distributions.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the performance of numerical models of coastal morphology against observations is an essential part of establishing their credibility. In the past, this has usually been done by comparing predicted with observed behavior, and the modeler making a subjective judgement of the goodness of fit. By contrast, meteorological models have been tested for many years against observations using objective, scientifically rigorous methods. Drawing on the analogy between distributions of atmospheric pressure (and similar scalars) and coastal bathymetry, the meteorological statistical methods are here adapted to coastal applications. A set of criteria is proposed that identify the desirable attributes of statistical measures of the performance of coastal morphological models. Various statistical parameters used in the meteorological field are described, dealing both with cases in which the model outputs comprise a small number of categories (e.g., advance/equilibrium/retreat of shoreline), and those in which they are continuous (e.g., bathymetry). Examples of the application of these methods are given, in terms of both hypothetical illustrations, and real field data and model predictions. Following meteorological practice, it is shown that measuring the skill of a model (i.e., its performance relative to a simple baseline predictor) is a more critical test than measuring its absolute accuracy. The attributes of the different performance measures are compared with the proposed desirable criteria, and those that match them best are selected. These are the LEPSOB test for categorical data, and the Brier Skill Score (BSS) for continuous data. Routine use of these measures of performance would aid inter-comparability of models, and be a step toward strengthening user confidence in the predictions of coastal numerical models.},

Conditions with prevailing bed-load transport, and conditions in which a significant part of the bed material is transported as suspended-load are studied. The effect of a sloping bed on the direction of sediment transport is determined by conducting bed-levelling experiments. Comparison of the results with data of curved flume experiments and experience gained with numerical computation of the bed topography in natural rivers yields the conclusion that, at least for bed-load transport, a distinction should be made between laboratory conditions and natural rivers. For conditions with suspended sediment transport the transverse slope effect can not be modelled identical as for bed-load transport.}

  abstract = {Phenological changes have been observed globally for marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, and are an important element of the global biological `fingerprint' of climate change. Differences in rates of change could desynchronize seasonal species interactions within a food web, threatening ecosystem functioning. Quantification of this risk is hampered by the rarity of long-term data for multiple interacting species from the same ecosystem and by the diversity of possible phenological metrics, which vary in their ecological relevance to food web interactions. We compare phenological change for phytoplankton (chlorophyll a), zooplankton (Daphnia) and fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis) in two basins of Windermere over 40 years and determine whether change has differed among trophic levels, while explicitly accounting for among-metric differences in rates of change. Though rates of change differed markedly among the nine metrics used, seasonal events shifted earlier for all metrics and trophic levels: zooplankton advanced most, and fish least, rapidly. Evidence of altered synchrony was found in both lake basins, when combining information from all phenological metrics. However, comparisons based on single metrics did not consistently detect this signal. A multimetric approach showed that across trophic levels, earlier phenological events have been associated with increasing water temperature. However, for phytoplankton and zooplankton, phenological change was also associated with changes in resource availability. Lower silicate, and higher phosphorus, concentrations were associated with earlier phytoplankton growth, and earlier phytoplankton growth was associated with earlier zooplankton growth. The developing trophic mismatch detected between the dominant fish species in Windermere and important zooplankton food resources may ultimately affect fish survival and portend significant impacts upon ecosystem functioning. We advocate that future studies on phenological synchrony combine data from multiple phenological metrics, to increase confidence in assessments of change and likely ecological consequences.},

In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, `Metapopulation Persistence' focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical (e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the `Water Filtration' optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for `Metapopulation Persistence,' as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1\% of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., ``win-win'' locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., ``tradeoff'' locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefits.},

The variables B (the point at which the parabola crosses the y axis) and P (a variable parameter less than 1.0) are selected to minimize the sum of the errors (Y - Ycalc)2, where Ycalc is the calculated value of Y. The equation Y = B + (1 - B)(1 - N)0.61 is selected as most representative, and the B values in this equation that minimize the sum of the errors squared for the individual stations are shown in Figure 1. The average absolute error of the 5306 data points is 1.18 MJ m-2, or 7\% of the average observed radiation.

Traditional ground-based survey methods are limited by survey time, dense vegetation and stream access, and are usually only feasible for short reaches. Conversely, airborne topobathymetric LiDAR surveys may overcome these limitations, although limited research is available on how errors in LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) might propagate through flow models. This study investigated the performance of LiDAR-derived topobathymetry in support of multi-dimensional flow modelling and ecohydraulics calculations in two gravel-bedded reaches (approximately 200 m long), one morphologically complex and one morphologically simple, and at the segment scale (32 km-long stream segment) along a 15 m-wide river in central Idaho, USA. We compared metre and sub-metre-resolution DEMs generated from RTK-GPS ground and Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR-B (EAARL-B) surveys and water depths, velocities, shear stresses, habitat suitability, and bed mobility modelled with two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models supported by LiDAR and ground-surveyed DEMs. Residual statistics, bias (B), and standard deviation (SD) of the residuals between depth and velocity predicted from the model supported by LiDAR and ground-survey topobathymetries were up to -0.04 (B) and 0.09 m (SD) for depth and -0.09 (B) and 0.20 m s-1 (SD) for velocity. The accuracy (B = 0.05 m), precision (SD = 0.09 m), and point density (1 point m-2) of the LiDAR topobathymetric survey (regardless of reach complexity) were sufficient to support 2D hydrodynamic modelling and derivative stream habitat and process analyses, because these statistics were comparable to those of model calibration with B = 0 m and SD = 0.04 m for water surface elevation and B = 0.05 m s-1 and SD = 0.22 m s-1 for velocity in our investigation. \textcopyright{} 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Summary This chapter deals with hydraulic modelling for predicting flow properties used in ecohydraulics, in its broader sense, which encompasses aquatic habitat modelling, ecological assessment and the interaction between flow and organisms. It discusses the basic knowledge and terminology of hydraulic modelling. The chapter focuses on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling and its application in ecohydraulics. It describes the fundamental equations of CFD. The methods for predicting flow properties are divided into four categories: three-dimensional (3D) hydraulic models, two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models, one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models and non-numerical hydraulic modelling. The chapter introduces the fundamental topics and concepts of numerical modeling. It describes the features of and differences among hydraulic model approaches and the major elements needed to set up numerical models. The chapter presents four case studies where the underlying hydrodynamic processes drive certain ecological functions, such as the availability of habitats for certain fish or types of vegetation.},

  abstract = {Restoration of an alluvial wet-meadow system was conducted in the late 1990s to reestablish hydraulic interactions between the river, floodplain, and groundwater to support aquatic\textendash riparian ecosystem function. A single-discharge approach sized the bankfull channel dimensions to the effective discharge (Qe) and three degrees of channel widening relative to the Qe design were explored to identify which design attained dynamic equilibrium in the shortest time. The three experimental channel designs were implemented with bankfull widths of 96\%, 157\%, and 191\%, respectively, of the Qe geometry. Response trajectories were documented for channel dimensions, sediment mobility, channel morphology, floodplain connectivity, and riparian vegetation for the three channel designs, and the efficacy of a single-discharge approach for restoration was examined. Analysis of 20~years of monitoring data and hydraulic modeling revealed that each design responded differently to the imposed initial channel conditions and evolved at substantially different rates. The design with bankfull dimensions most closely approximating Qe reached dynamic equilibrium within four years of restoration, whereas the moderately over-widened channel (57\% larger) exhibited slower responses toward dynamic equilibrium for some metrics and did not fully attain the Qe design dimensions within the monitoring period. The extremely-over-widened channel (91\% larger) mainly induced slow rates of bed deposition that are projected to take nearly 300~years for the bankfull dimensions to narrow to the Qe width. All reaches had low bed mobility (bankfull Shields stress~{$<~$}0.03) 14~years after restoration, demonstrating the challenge of reducing the drivers of channel widening, while maintaining sufficient competence for bedload transport and a sustained supply of coarse bed material for salmonid habitat. Restoration that sizes the channel to Qe can provide rapid dynamic equilibrium, but is a first-order simplification of 1) channel dynamics and 2) the range of flows needed for restoring physical and biological processes in wet-meadow systems.},

  abstract = {Given the limited resources available for managing erosion hazards and addressing water quality impairment along rivers, stakeholders engaged in water resource management would benefit from tools to identify those river reaches most prone to adjustment and which disproportionately load sediment to receiving waters. The extent and rate of vertical and lateral channel adjustments in response to natural and human disturbances vary considerably across space and time; and this complexity and nonlinearity introduce challenges for classification or modelling of river reaches using conventional statistical techniques. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a data-driven computational tool with advantages for clustering or classifying multivariate observations and for exploratory data analysis and visualization of complex, nonlinear systems. We applied a SOM to cluster multivariate stream geomorphic assessment data into reach-scale sediment process domains for 193 river reaches in glacially-conditioned catchments of northeastern US using field- and GIS-derived hydraulic and geomorphic parameters. The reaches comprised a range of channel types from confined to unconfined, steep- to shallow-gradient, mid-to-high order, and bedrock to alluvial channels. Fifteen variables were identified that meaningfully separated reaches into seven sediment regimes, following a two-stage application of the SOM. A coarse-tune SOM identified sediment regime classes at the supply-limited and transport-limited extremes of a continuum, including bedrock channels and confined, steep-gradient reaches as well as braided, depositional channels at alluvial fan or delta settings. A second-stage, fine-tune SOM nuanced differences in sediment production and transport for unconfined reaches with varying degrees of floodplain disconnection resulting from natural or human stressors. This classification framework is transferable to other hydroclimatic regions, with consideration of additional or alternate independent variables unique to those regions, and can provide valuable insights for river management to promote flood resiliency, restore water quality and improve instream and riparian habitats.},

Three side channels of Gameren in the river Waal (The Netherlands) show amounts of large aggradation. We use bed level measurements and grain size samples to characterize the development of the side channels. We relate the bed level changes and the deposited sediment in the side channels to the results of hydrodynamic computations. Two of the three side channels filled mainly with suspended bed-material load. In one of these channels, the bed level increased enough that vegetation has grown and fine suspended load has settled. In the third side channel, the bed shear stresses are much smaller and, in addition to the suspended bed-material load, fine sediment settles. Based on the side channel system at Gameren, we identify two types of side channels: one type fills predominantly with suspended bed-material load from the main channel and a second type fills predominantly with fine suspended load. This gives an indication of the main mechanisms that lead to the aggradation in artificial side channel systems.},

Via excretory processes, animals can supply nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) at rates comparable to major nutrient sources, and nutrient cycling by animals can support a substantial proportion of the nutrient demands of primary producers. In addition, animals may exert strong impacts on the species composition of primary producers via effects on nutrient supply rates and ratios. Animals can either recycle nutrients within a habitat, or translocate nutrients across habitats or ecosystems. Nutrient translocation by relatively large animals may be particularly important for stimulating new primary production and for increasing nutrient standing stocks in recipient habitats. Animals also have numerous indirect effects on nutrient fluxes via effects on their prey or by modification of the physical environment. Future studies must quantify how the importance of animal-mediated nutrient cycling varies among taxa and along environmental gradients such as ecosystem size and productivity.},

  abstract = {Species conservation, river rehabilitation, stock enhancement, environmental impact assessment and related planning tools require indicators to identify significant impacts but also mitigation success. Since river systems are shaped by disturbances from floods and droughts, typical riverine fish species should have evolved life history traits providing resilience against such disturbances. This study compiled and analyzed resilience traits of European lampreys and fish species to derive a novel sensitivity classification of species to mortality. We assembled life history traits like maximum length, migration type, mortality, fecundity, age at maturity, and generation time of 168 species and created a novel method to weigh and integrate all traits to generate a final sensitivity score from one (low sensitivity) to three (high sensitivity) for each species. Large-bodied, diadromous, rheophilic and lithophilic species such as sturgeons, sea trout, and Atlantic salmon usually appeared to have high sensitivity to additional adult fish mortality, whereas small-bodied, limnophilic and phytophilic species with fast generation cycles were of low sensitivity. The final scoring and classification of 168 European lampreys and fish species according to their sensitivity can be easily regionalized by selecting the most sensitive candidates according to the local species pool. This sensitivity classification has major implications for advancing impact assessment, allowing better targeting of species for conservation measures, benchmarking progress during rehabilitation and enhancing the objective evaluation of the success of restoration projects.},

  abstract = {River forms and processes are, in many cases, conditioned by the consequences of anthropogenic modifications, widespread during the last two centuries, such as dams, embankments and gravel-mining. The effects of these human impacts have been typically investigated by fluvial geomorphologists based on a so-called expert-based approach whereby observed association or synchronicity between geomorphological changes and a given, preidentified impact, are interpreted as evidence of causation. This approach has important limitations when the effects of multiple human interventions interact along the same river corridor or overlap with legacy natural changes affecting the sediment - water balance. In such situations, the establishment of causal links between channel morphology and single impacts is not as straightforward as commonly assumed and our conclusions may be affected by `confirmation biases'. In this paper we highlight this risk through an assessment of human impacts on the Rh\^one river within a multi-driver context. The French Rh\^one is a perfect example of an Anthropocene river impacted by two main development phases during the 20th century: river training (1890s -1930s) and the construction of a series of dams (1950s -1990s). In this study we began by laying out four hypothetical and geomorphologically consistent scenarios for the geomorphological trajectory followed by the Rh\^one over the 20th century. Next, we tested these hypothetical scenarios against grain-size data collected in the field in a structured and hypothesis-oriented way. Using this hypothesis-driven and deductive attribution analysis we identified the relative impacts of the different development phases on the present-day grain-size distribution and in particular on armouring in the Rh\^one river, and proposed a hierarchy of dominant drivers of geomorphological change along the Rhone over the last century and a half. Based on the results of our study, we concluded that in the case of the Rh\^one, the effect of dams on armouring was negligible compared to a legacy of natural heritages and embankments.},

There are many reasons to compare maps: (i) to detect temporal/spatial changes or hot-spots, (ii) to compare different models, methodologies or scenarios, (iii) to calibrate, validate land-use models, (iv) to analyse model uncertainty and sensitivity, and (v) to assess map accuracy. This paper addresses the quantification of map similarities and dissimilarities using the Map Comparison Kit (MCK) software. Software and documentation are publicly available on the RIKS website free of charge (http://www.riks.nl/MCK/). The main focus is on \dbend categorical\dbend{} or \dbend nominal\dbend{} maps. Four different nominal map-comparison techniques are integrated in the software. Maps on ordinal, ratio and interval scale can be dealt with as well. The software is unique in having two map comparison techniques based on fuzzy-set calculation rules. The rationale is that fuzzy-set map comparison is very close to human judgement. Both fuzziness in location and fuzziness in category definitions are dealt with in the software.},

  abstract = {The temperature of river water plays a crucial role in many physical, chemical, and aquatic ecological processes. Despite the importance of having detailed information on this environmental variable at locally relevant scales ({$\leq$}50 km), high-resolution simulations of water temperature on a large scale are currently lacking. We have developed the dynamical 1-D water energy routing model (DynWat), that solves both the energy and water balance, to simulate river temperatures for the period 1960\textendash 2014 at a nominal 10-km and 50-km resolution. The DynWat model accounts for surface water abstraction, reservoirs, riverine flooding, and formation of ice, enabling a realistic representation of the water temperature. We present a novel 10-km water temperature data set at the global scale for all major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Validated results against 358 stations worldwide indicate a decrease in the simulated root-mean-square error (0.2 \textdegree C) and bias (0.7 \textdegree C), going from 50- to 10-km simulations. We find an average global increase in water temperature of 0.16 \textdegree C per decade between 1960 and 2014, with more rapid warming toward 2014. Results show increasing trends for the annual daily maxima in the Northern Hemisphere (0.62 \textdegree C per decade) and the annual daily minima in the Southern Hemisphere (0.45 \textdegree C per decade) for 1960\textendash 2014. The high-resolution modeling framework not only improves the model performance, it also positively impacts the relevance of the simulations for regional-scale studies and impact assessments in a region without observations. The resulting global water temperature data set could help to improve the accuracy of decision-support systems that depend on water temperature estimates.},

Channel adjustment and step stability in a short timescale (i.e., in a 4-h run) were mostly controlled by the magnitude and frequency of sediment pulses. A coarser sediment feed mixture led to a coarser bed surface which increased both sediment storage in the channel and step stability.

Using datasets of river water discharge, water consumption and regional precipitation for the past 50~years, we elucidate some connections between decreasing water discharges, global El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and anthropogenic impacts in the drainage basin. Global ENSO events, which directly affected the regional precipitation in the river basin, resulted in approximately 51\% decrease in river water discharge to the sea. The degree of anthropogenic impacts on river water discharge is now as great as that of natural influences, accelerating the water losses in the hydrological cycle. The large dams and reservoirs regulated the water discharge and reduced the peak flows by storing the water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season as needed for agricultural irrigation. Thus, as a result, large dams and reservoirs have shifted the seasonal distribution patterns of water discharge and water consumption and finally resulted in rapidly increasing water consumption. Meanwhile, the annual distribution pattern of water consumption also changed under the regulation of dams and reservoirs, indicating that the people living in the river basin consume the water more and more to suit actual agricultural schedule rather than depending upon natural pattern of annual precipitation. The combination of the increasing water consumption facilitated by the dams and reservoirs and the decreasing precipitation closely associated with the global ENSO events over the past half century has resulted in water scarcity in this world-famous river, as well as in a number of subsequent serious results for the river, delta and coastal ocean.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of fine sediments in rivers is a pernicious problem with wide-ranging consequences for the healthy functioning of rivers throughout the world. It is linked to a range of landuse changes and human activities that have increased sediment inputs leading to elevated fine sediment loads that exceed the sediment transport capacities of rivers. Surficial deposits of fine material can also create the conditions for fine sediment to move into and accumulate within the coarser bed substrate, a process known as colmation and the focus of this review. Colmation, also referred to as clogging, fine sediment infiltration, fine sediment deposition, ingress, infilling, intrusion of fines, siltation, and the surface\textendash subsurface exchange of particles, is particularly damaging to river habitats and ecosystems. It causes degradation through the physical effects of reduced porosity and flow connectivity and the biogeochemical changes arising from the hydraulic and hydrological impacts and the effects of sediment-bound contaminants, all of which can impact on river ecology. Different aspects of the phenomenon of colmation have been studied across a number of disciplines and over several decades and this paper synthesizes this wide literature to provide a multidisciplinary perspective on the mechanisms, causes, and impacts of colmation and discusses some key management challenges.

Ripples with wavelengths proportional to near-bed wave orbital diameter (orbital ripples), predominant in laboratory experiments, are found to have heights in excess of the thickness of the wave boundary layer. Ripples with wavelengths that are roughly proportional to grain size and nearly independent of orbital diameter (anorbital ripples), which predominate in the field, have heights at least several times smaller than wave boundary layer thickness. Relating wave boundary layer height to the generally more easily estimated wave orbital diameter, a set of expressions are developed for predicting ripple type and geometry based on mean grain size, wave orbital diameter, and estimated anorbital ripple height. This method provides a good characterization of ripple wavelength and steepness for a large set of combined field and flume data.},

Fractional transport rates are referenced to the size distribution of the bed surface, rather than subsurface, making the model completely explicit and capable of predicting transient conditions. The model is developed using a new data set of 48 coupled observations of flow, transport, and bed surface grain size using five different sediments. The model incorporates a hiding function that resolves discrepancies observed among earlier hiding functions. The model uses the full size distribution of the bed surface, including sand, and incorporates a nonlinear effect of sand content on gravel transport rate not included in previous models. The model shares some common elements with two previous surface-based transport models, but differs in using the full surface size distribution and in that it is directly developed from a relatively comprehensive data set with unambiguous measurement of surface grain size over a range of flow, transport rate, and sediments.},

River connectivity is typically described in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dimensions within the river corridor and the watershed and can be conceptualized as a continuum from fully connected to disconnected over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Explicit characterization of connectivity helps understanding of disparities among short-term, local rates of flux and inferred fluxes over larger scales. Connectivity also strongly influences the response of rivers to natural and human disturbances. Investigations of connectivity facilitate the recognition of processes that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries, as well as understanding of nonlinear behavior and retention within rivers. Enhancing the ability to identify, quantify, and predict the processes that create and maintain connectivity is integral to the effective management of rivers.},

Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, stratification will begin 22.0\,{$\pm$}\,7.0 days earlier and end 11.3\,{$\pm$}\,4.7 days later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3\,{$\pm$}\,11.7 day prolongation in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is also likely.},

  abstract = {Process-based numerical models are frequently used by policymakers and water managers for decision-support in effective water quantity and quality management of urban water system reservoirs and lakes. Such models (e.g., Delft3D hydrodynamic and water quality models) typically involve systems of partial differential equations and are highly parameterized and expensive to compute. Hence, extensive human and computational effort for parameter calibration are required. Recent studies have demonstrated that High-Performance Computing (HPC) and efficient optimization techniques can be effective in automatic calibration and scenario optimization of computationally expensive environmental models. This study applies a parallel surrogate-assisted global optimization method within a simulation-optimization framework for efficient automatic calibration of computationally expensive lake hydrodynamic and water quality models. The simulation-optimization framework is implemented generically for Delft3D hydrodynamic and water quality models, and can also be applied to water quality planning and management optimization formulations. We apply our parallel framework for i) calibration of water temperature for a computationally expensive reservoir Delft3D hydrodynamics model (Delft3D-FLOW) and ii) multi-constituent (Chlorophyll-A, Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus) calibration of a reservoir Delft3D water quality model (Delft3D-WAQ). Both Delft3D models solve lots of partial differential equations and are expensive to compute. A single 1-year simulation of the hydrodynamics model with time step 1.5 minutes takes 4 to 5 hours on a Windows desktop with CPU Intel Core i7-4790. The reservoir water quality model requires 15-20 minutes for simulating given input from the hydrodynamics model. We ran our parallel calibration experiments on ASPIRE1 which is Singapore's first petascale supercomputer. Results indicate that our simulation-optimization framework performs considerably better and require significantly less computational and human effort (order of days) than manual calibration. A key purpose of this study is to illustrate (to policymakers and water managers) that efficient parallel surrogate-assisted simulation-optimization frameworks can be effectively used to calibrate the computationally expensive Delft3D models developed for Singapore's urban reservoirs with relatively few model evaluations. In future we plan to run these algorithms on Delft3D models asynchronously to further improve computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Predicted bedload fluxes often have large errors partly because calculations usually do not include spatial and temporal flow variability. Sediment motion is driven by a temporal distribution of applied fluid forces, which are often simplified into time-averaged flow velocities or shear stresses in sediment transport equations. Spatial variations in these flow parameters are also often neglected. Given the nonlinearities in the relation between flow and sediment flux, the reach-averaged sediment flux calculated with an average velocity or shear stress will not necessarily equal the measured spatially averaged bedload flux. Such spatial and temporal flow variations are ignored with the commonly used reach-averaged shear stress ({$\tau$}ds) that is a function of the flow depth and channel slope. To demonstrate the uncertainties with using reach-averaged shear stresses, and even local shear stresses, to predict bedload transport rates, we have three goals. First, we outline the derivations and assumptions involved with commonly used estimates of shear stress. Second, we summarize the literature on the uncertainties involved with using shear stress, and other space- and time-averaged flow parameters, to predict sediment flux. Third, we use a new data set from experiments to add further support to a growing body of literature that suggests {$\tau$}ds may not be linked to the mechanics of bedload transport. We show considerable uncertainties exist in estimating a reach-averaged shear stress, by comparing {$\tau$}ds and near-bed shear stresses calculated from velocity profiles, Reynolds stresses, and local turbulence. For example, {$\tau$}ds was systematically greater than these near-bed stresses even for experiments without large bed roughness. We also find that correlations between local time-averaged sediment fluxes and local Reynolds stresses or turbulence intensities are relatively poor. The near-bed, time-averaged local flow velocity has the strongest relation with the time-averaged local bedload flux because it is closely related to the forces that actually drive sediment transport. However, sediment transport rates in individual experiments could still vary by orders of magnitude for a given value of this flow velocity, suggesting that additional work is needed to identity a parameter, or distributions of parameters, that will best predict sediment fluxes.},

In this study, a simple model that can explicitly account for radiative transfer processes in the atmosphere is developed to estimate hourly and daily solar radiation. Its inputs are surface meteorological data (sunshine duration, air temperature, and relative humidity), so it can be easily applied to hydrological modeling. The radiation model is compared with the Food and Agricultural Organization radiation model and globally and locally calibrated \AA ngstr\"om-Prescott models at a number of sites in various climate and elevation regions, and it is suggested that the new model is more general and more accurate, especially for estimating hourly solar radiation.

Its inherent lack of shock-capturing capability often results in spurious oscillations and computational instabilities. However, the ADI scheme is still widely adopted in flood modelling software, and various special treatments have been designed to stabilise the computation. Modification of the Boussinesq coefficient to adjust the amount of fluid inertia is a numerical treatment that allows the ADI scheme to be applicable to rapid flows. This study comprehensively examines the impact of this numerical treatment over a range of flow conditions. A shock-capturing TVD-MacCormack model is used to provide reference results. For unsteady flows over a frictionless bed, such as idealised dam-break floods, the results suggest that an increase in the value of the Boussinesq coefficient reduces the amplitude of the spurious oscillations. The opposite is observed for steady rapid flows over a frictional bed. Finally, a two-dimensional urban flooding phenomenon is presented, involving unsteady flow over a frictional bed. The results show that increasing the value of the Boussinesq coefficient can significantly reduce the numerical oscillations and reduce the predicted area of inundation. In order to stabilise the ADI computations, the Boussinesq coefficient could be judiciously raised or lowered depending on whether the rapid flow is steady or unsteady and whether the bed is frictional or frictionless. An increase in the Boussinesq coefficient generally leads to overprediction of the propagating speed of the flood wave over a frictionless bed, but the opposite is true when bed friction is significant.},

Fish habitat suitability models assess habitat quality, based on abiotic parameters, namely, flow velocity, depth, and substratum data. These are all derived from a hydro-morpho-dynamic model. The relationships between parameters and habitat features are represented as suitability index curves (SI curves) or fuzzy rules. To dynamically simulate fish species, two different population models are developed. The first is converted from a logistic population concept. Its model parameters are related to time-dependent fish habitat conditions, namely, weighted usable areas and an overall suitability index. The second model is based on a matrix population concept, with numbers as the only state vector. Age-specific fecundities and survival rates depend on the habitat qualities defined in the matrix population model. The eco-hydraulic model provides very promising results, highlighting the fundamental role of temporal variability of hydro-morphological parameters in structuring habitat and populations of fish species. Using this software to anticipate water management changes, simulated population trends can help decision-makers optimize management measures.},

In this study, a 2D ecohydraulic model system was proposed and used to evaluate the habitat suitability index, weighted useable areas, overall suitability index, fish population number, and fish population density of Colorado River. The 2D ecohydraulic model system comprised hydrodynamic, hydromorphology, habitat, and population models. Three fish species were selected as target fish, which included rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis). Five computational domains of the Colorado River were selected for the ecohydraulic model. The surveyed fish data from 2000 to 2009 were used to calibrate the model system. Results indicated that the predicted fish number showed a good agreement with the surveyed fish. It is indicated that the rainbow trout and brown trout fish number showed decreasing trends from 2000 to 2009, while flannelmouth sucker showed increasing trend from 2000 to 2009. The proposed approach demonstrates that the ecohydraulic model system can be used to accurately simulate the river habitat quality and population status. The ecohydraulic model can be an efficient tool to improve understanding of the different scenarios and to assistant for multiple fish habitat and population prediction in river system. It can also provide decision-makers with valuable information to optimize their management.},

  abstract = {In recent years, dam management guidelines need to estimate the effects of downstream flow on environment. However, high-flow alters physical conditions such as water depth, flow velocity and water temperature in the downstream side of the river. These changes will lead to alteration in fish habitat of the river. In this paper, an eco-hydraulic model was used to determine the levels of fish habitat in the Colorado River downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam. This model has been proposed by combining hydrodynamic and heat transfer model with a habitat suitability index model based on fish preference curves. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) were chosen as target species because they represent both native and non-native fish in the study area. Flow velocity, water depth and water temperature were selected as the suitability indicators. The hydrological data from three high-flow experiments were analyzed to determine the effects of high-flow on the Colorado River ecosystem. Numerical model simulations were undertaken as follows: firstly, based on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer equation, three hydraulic factors including water depth, velocity and temperature distribution were simulated and the associated suitability for each was obtained based on the fish preference curves. Later, the habitat suitability equation was developed to simulate the target species\dbend{} habitat situation in high flow effects. Finally, the WUA (weighted usable area) and OSI (overall suitability index) of the spawning fish species were quantitatively calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the high flow. The results show that the effects of three HFE are more severe in spawning flannelmouth sucker than in spawning rainbow trout. It is worth noting that the one day HFE was beneficial to spawning rainbow trout and harmful to spawning flannelmouth sucker but in the HFE of more than 8 days, both the spawning habitats were completely destroyed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The evolution of river morphology is very complicated to predict, especially in the case of mountain and Piedmont rivers with complex morphologies, steep slopes, and heterogeneous grain sizes such as the "Lac des Gaves" (LDG) reach, located within the Gave de Pau river in the Hautes-Pyr\&eacute;n\&eacute;es department, France, has precisely the complex morphological characteristics mentioned above. This reach has gone through severe sediment extractions for over 50 years, leading to the construction of two weirs for riverbed stabilisation. Two large floods resulted in changes in the LDG's hydromorphological characteristics as it went from a single channel river section to a braided river reach. In this study, a 2D hydromorphological model is developed with the TELEMAC-MASCARET system to reproduce the evolution of the channel following a flood that occurred in 2018. The model's validity is assessed by comparing the simulated topographic evolution to the observed one. The results reveal the challenge of choosing well-fitted sediment transport equations and friction laws that would make it possible to reproduce such complex morphology. Even if the exact localisation of the multiple channels forming the braided nature of the LDG was challenging to reproduce, our model could provide reliable volumetric predictions as it reproduces the filling of the LDG correctly. The influence of the two weirs on the river's current and future morphology is also studied. The aim is to provide decision-makers with more reliable predictions to design suitable restoration measures for the LDG reach.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Food chain length is a fundamental ecosystem property, and plays a central role in determining ecosystem functioning. Recent advances in the field of stable isotope ecology allow the estimation of food chain length (FCL) from stable nitrogen isotope ({$\delta$}15N) data. We conducted a global literature synthesis and estimated FCL for 219 lake, stream, and marine ecosystems. Streams had shorter food chains ({$\sim$}3.5 trophic levels) than marine and lake ecosystems ({$\sim$}4.0 trophic levels). In marine systems, inclusion of marine mammals increased FCL by 2/3 of a trophic level. For each ecosystem type, estimates of FCL were normally distributed and spanned two full trophic levels. Comparison with published connectance food webs revealed similar mean FCL values, though stable isotope-derived FCL estimates were less variable. At the global scale, FCL showed weak or no relationships with ecosystem size, mean annual air temperature, or latitude. Our study highlights the utility of stable isotopes for quantifying among-system food web variability, and the application of this approach for assessing global-scale patterns of food chain length.},

  abstract = {Study region Tarago Reservoir, Victoria, Australia. Study focus This study investigates the influence of rainfall, river inflow and wind on the temperature stratification of the Tarago Reservoir by incorporating atmospheric and bathymetric conditions using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. New hydrological insights for this region In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model was developed and applied to the Tarago Reservoir. The model allowed 3D visualization of the thermal structure, and the seasonal and longitudinal differences in stratification could be quantified using the Schmidt stability index. The simulation results revealed longitudinal differences in thermal structure among the riverine, transition, and lacustrine zones. The bathymetry affects the lake stratification and stability; furthermore, the strong vertical current caused by the sharp bathymetry gradient significantly weakens the stability in deep zones. In addition, this study assessed the impacts of rainfall and wind on lake stability using sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that rainfall decreases the water temperature of the lake but hardly affects the summer stratification. Moreover, the wind not only influences the intensity and duration of stratification but also contributes to the heat storage of waterbodies. The patterns of water current velocities and temperature also showed that the circulation generated by overflow and underflow plumes have a crucial effect on the thermal structure of the transition and lacustrine zones.},
